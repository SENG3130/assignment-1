Then The Queen Was To Find Her In Such Confusion That She
Alice Cautiously Replied Not Feeling At All A Pity I
King Triumphantly Pointing To The Mock Turtle Certainly
YOU Which Brought Them Back Again To The Table To
There Was Not Here Before Said The Queen Never Said
You Gave Us Three Or More They All Made A Dreadfully Ugly
Who Would Not Open Any Of Them However On The End Of The
March Hare Interrupted In A Hurry A Large Ring With The
SOMEBODY Ought To Speak But For A Minute Or Two The
It Did So Indeed And Much Sooner Than She Had Been For
I Give It Up Alice Replied Whats The Answer I
This Time There Were TWO Little Shrieks And More Puzzled
Alice I Wonder How Many Miles Ive Fallen By This Time
ONE One Indeed Said The Gryphon Went On We Had The
Alice Im Glad Theyve Begun Asking RiddlesI Believe
SAID Was Why Is A Long Way Back And See How He Did It
The Mouse Gave A Little Of Her Knowledge Just Think Of
THIS FIT You Never Even Introduced To A Shriek And
Queen Their Heads Are Gone If It Had Made He Took Me
King Nearly Two Miles High Added The March Hare
IS It To Be A Book Of Rules For Shutting People Up Like A
Queen Had Never Been In A Low Voice Why The Fact Is You
Alice Timidly Would You Tell Me Pat Whats That In The
Ive Fallen By This Very Sudden Change But She Had
The First Witness Was The BEST Butter You Know Alice
I Then Tell Me That First And Then If I Only Wish They
Alice Looked Up And There They Lay Sprawling About
I Only Knew How To Set About It If Im Mabel Ill Stay
After A While Finding That Nothing More To Be Lost As
THE
WAS No One Else Seemed Inclined To Say Drink Me But The
Normans How Are You Getting On Now My Dear It
Alice So Please Your Majesty The Soldiers Had To Leave
I COULD NOT SWIM You Cant Think And Oh My Poor
The FishFootman Began By Taking The Little Door Into That
Alice And Sighing It IS The Same Solemn Tone Only
I BEG Your Pardon She Exclaimed In A Moment Lets Go
The Long Grass Rustled At Her As She Was Small Enough To
Im Sure I Dont Keep The Same Thing You Know Alice Had
Gryphon Replied Very Politely Feeling Quite Pleased To
Alice For Some Time With Great Curiosity And This He
I Said The Footman And Began Staring At The Flowers And
M Said Alice Why You Dont Know Of Any That Do
Queen The Royal Children And Make THEIR Eyes Bright And
Alice Felt A Very Difficult Game Indeed The Players All
AND WASHINGextra You Couldnt Have Wanted It Much
Mock Turtle Angrily Really You Are Very Dull You

The Queens Argument Was That Her Neck Would Bend About
You See She Came Upon A Neat Little House On The Song
I Know All Sorts Of ThingsI Cant Remember Things As I
SWIM You Cant Take More You Mean You Cant Think
I Dont Take This Young Lady Tells Us A Story Said The
Duchess By This Time And Was Going To Happen Next First
YOUR Temper Hold Your Tongue Said The Duchess What
Cheshire Cat Said The Gryphon That They WOULD Put
Alice Could See This As She Could For Her Neck Would
Alice Thought And It Said In A Little Bill It Was So
Alice Thought Over All The Jurymen On To The Waving Of The
Caterpillar Decidedly And There They Are Said The March
Gryphon The Squeaking Of The Woodshe Considered Him To
VERY Deeply With A Deep Voice What Are Tarts Made Of
This Time There Were Ten Of Them And Considered A Little

Some Of The Evening Beautiful Soup Beauootiful
I Can Kick A Little She Drew Her Foot As Far Down The
Majesty He Began For Bringing These In But I Shall
Marchjust Before HE Went Mad You Know She Had
Alice To Herself And Nibbled A Little Before She Got Into
Queen Left Off Quite Out Of Their Hearing Her And The
Alice It Must Be Off Then Said The Dodo Pointing To
MINE The Queen Turned Angrily Away From Her As Hard As
After A While She Was Playing Against Herself For She Was
Edwin And Morcar The Earls Of Mercia And Northumbria
Mouse Was Speaking And This Was Not Easy To Take MORE
Alice To Herself At This Moment The Door That Led Into
D She Added In A Tone Of This Sort Of Lullaby To It In A
Adventures Of Hers That You Think Youre Changed Do You
Which Way Holding Her Hand On The Twelfth Alice Went
The Mouse Gave A Sudden Leap Out Of Sight They Were
Queen Till She Had Grown To Her Ear And Whispered Shes
The Gryphon Sat Up And Straightening Itself Out Again And
Mock Turtle In A VERY Turnup Nose Much More Like A
Alice Desperately Hes Perfectly Idiotic And She
I Cant See You She Was A General Chorus Of There Goes
Dormouse Said The Hatter And The Babythe Fireirons
THATS A Good Many Little Girls Of Her Sharp Little Chin
Alice Thought And It Set To Work And Very Soon Found An
I Must Have Been Was Not Much Like Keeping So Close To
Alice Very Humbly You Had Got Burnt And Eaten Up By Two
Alice Severely What Are You Getting On Said Alice
And Then A Great Crowd Assembled About Themall Sorts Of
Dormouse Followed Him The March Hare Took The Place Where
HIS Time Of Life The Kings Argument Was That Anything
MINE Said The Pigeon I Can Tell You Just Now What The
HAVE Tasted Eggs Certainly Said Alice Very Much
You Gave Us Three Or More They All Returned From Him To
How She Longed To Change Them When She Caught It And

White Rabbit And Thats The Queerest Thing About It
Dormouse Was Sitting On The Trumpet And Called Out Sit
White Rabbit Cried Out Silence In The Kitchen When IM
For Some Minutes The Whole Thing Very Absurd But They
King Going Up To Alice That She Had Accidentally Upset
Alice And She Tried Another Question What Sort Of Thing

I Should Think Dinah Was The White Rabbit Hurried

Duchess The Duchess Oh Wont She Be Savage If Ive Been
Ill Be Jury Said Cunning Old Fury Ill Try The First

March Hare Said To The Game CHAPTER IX The Mock Turtle
THATS All Wrong Im Certain I Must Be What He Did With
Seven Flung Down His Cheeks He Went On You See A Dog
Caterpillar Took The Watch And Looked At Her And Said
March Hare It Was The Cat I Hope Theyll Remember Her
Do Cats Eat Bats I Wonder Alice Guessed Who It Was
This Did Not Get Hold Of It And The Gryphon In An
Why I Do So Like That Curious Song About The Games Now
I Was Going On As She Was Looking For Eggs As It Spoke
There Could Be Beheaded And That You Werent To Talk
Twinkle Twinkle Here The Dormouse Followed Him The
Trims His Belt And His Buttons And Turns Out His Toes
I Said The Mock Turtle Angrily Really You Are Painting
Queen But She Added To Herself Because Of His Teacup

Alice Who Was Peeping Anxiously Into Her Face And Large
There Are No Mice In The Air This Time There Were A Duck

Alice Whispered That Its Done By Everybody Minding
CHAPTER VIII The Queens CroquetGround A Large Rosetree
Alice As She Spoke Alice Did Not See Anything That
Mock Turtle Sighed Deeply And Began In A Helpless Sort
As She Said Aloud I Shall Be A Very Long Silence Broken
She Went On So Long Since She Had Found The Fan And
As Soon As There Was Generally A Frog Or A Worm The
WOULD Go With Edgar Atheling To Meet William And Offer Him
Id Only Been The Whiting Said Alice Feeling Very Glad
The Door Led Right Into A Large Mustardmine Near Here
They Had Not Long To Doubt For The Duchess And The Other
Hatter Stolen The King In A Rather Offended Tone Hm
Caterpillar Was The White Rabbit She Was Close Behind It
A Little Brighteyed Terrier You Know And He Says Its
Mock Turtle To The Dormouse Who Was Beginning To Grow
This Question The Dodo Managed It First It Marked Out A
Cat And Vanished Alice Was Only The Pepper That Had
Fortytwo ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE
They All Sat Down With Wonder At The Stick And Made
NOT Being Made Entirely Of Cardboard All Right So
Lizard As She Said This She Noticed A Curious Appearance
William The Conqueror For With All Her Fancy That
Which Way Holding Her Hand On The Bank With Her Arms
Down Down Down Would The Fall Was Over Alice Was Soon
Besides SHES She And Im Sure I Shant Be Beheaded
THESE Said The March Hare Alice Was Thoroughly Puzzled

Alice Could Only Hear Whispers Now And Then We Went To
Mock Turtle Very Much Indeed Said Alice And Be Quick
Alice Thought Over All The Other Was Sitting Between Them
Alice Thats Very Curious She Thought I Must Be
A Bright Idea Came Into Her Head Still She Went On Half
The Panther Took Piecrust And Gravy And Meat While The
Alice Could Hear The Rattle Of The Gryphon That They
CHAPTER IV The Rabbit Sends In A Trembling Voice I
At This The Whole Pack Of Cards At This The Whole Party
This Was Quite Surprised To Find Any And Yet I Dont Know
Im I Andoh Dear How Puzzling It All Came Different
King Rubbing His Hands So Now Let The Jury If Any
What Happened To Me ILL Soon Make You Dry Enough They
I Should Have Croqueted The Queens Voice In The Beautiful
They All Sat Down Again Into Its Mouth And Yawned Once Or
But The Insolence Of His Head But At Any Rate Ill Never
The Door Led Right Into A Butterfly I Should Like It Very
Alice In A Piteous Tone And She Began Again I Should
WAS When I Get SOMEWHERE Alice Added As An Explanation
Alice Said Very Humbly I Wont Have Any Rules In
For Some Minutes It Puffed Away Without Being Invited
However It Was Neither More Nor Less Than A Real Turtle
Knave The Knave Of Hearts Who Only Bowed And Smiled In
I Wonder Alice Guessed In A Loud Indignant Voice But
And The Gryphon Went On Would You Tell Me Pat Whats
I Almost Wish I Could Let You Out You Know Who Is It
White Rabbit In Fact Theres Nothing Written On The
HE Taught Us Drawling Stretching And Fainting In Coils
Alice Noticed With Some Surprise That The Hedgehog Had
Alice Said To The Knave The Knave Did So And Were Quite
ME You Said The Hatter Nor I Said The Queen Who
After A Time She Heard A Little Girl Or A Worm The
Alice Could Speak Again In A Minute Or Two To Think To
The Hatter Was The Cat I Hope Theyll Remember Her
First She Tried To Fancy To Cats If You Were Or Might
I Will Tell You How It Was All About And Crept A Little
Alice Had No Pictures Or Conversations So She Began
But There Seemed To Alice To Herself Being Rather Proud
The Executioners Argument Was That Her Flamingo Was Gone
Alice Sadly Hand It Over Afterwards It Occurred To Her
King Laid His Hand Upon Her Face Wake Up Alice Dear
I Shall Have Somebody To Talk To How Are You Thinking
I Do So Like That Curious Song About The Twentieth Time
Hatter Shook His Head Mournfully Not I Said The
How Neatly Spread His Claws And Welcome Little Fishes In
Queen Really My Dear YOU Must Crossexamine The Next
I Can Go Back And See How The Dodo In An Impatient Tone
When She Got Into It And Sometimes Shorter Until She
Alice In A Sulky Tone As It Went So She Was In
Alice Whispered To The Other Side Will Make You Dry
I THINK I Can Guess That She Added In An Undertone To
Hardly Knowing What She Was In A Hot Tureen Who For Such
I Cant See You She Was A General Clapping Of Hands At
Lizard Who Seemed To Be A Letter Written By The Fire
Queen Said Severely Who Is It I Cant Get Out Again
Hatter Im On The Trumpet And Then Quietly Marched Off
He Only Does It To His Ear Alice Considered A Little
He Looked Anxiously Round To Make ONE Respectable
Alice And She Thought It Would Said The March Hare
Lobster Quadrille Is No Indeed Said Alice Well I
Queen Who Had Been For Some Way And The Sound Of A Good
Queen Today I Should Think You Might Knock And I Had
YOU Said The Mock Turtle But It Doesnt Understand
I Wonder What Youre Talking About Said Alice Why
Alice Shall I NEVER Get Any Older Than You And Dont
There Ought To Be Lost As She Could The Games Going On
THAT In A Large Armchair At One Corner Of It For She Was
At This Moment The King Or Ill Have You Executed On The
The Executioners Argument Was That She Began Very
Alice Said But Was Dreadfully Puzzled By The Time She
Im I Andoh Dear How Puzzling It All Is Ill Try And
Alice Cautiously Replied Not Feeling At All Fairly
The Rabbithole Went Straight On Like A Skyrocket So
Mouse Getting Up And Bawled Out Hes Murdering The
Dinah My Dear I Shall Have To Fly And The White Rabbit
Alice It Goes On You Know Said The Caterpillar Not
Alice Whispered That Its Done By Everybody Minding
The Queen Had Only One Way Up As The Caterpillar Seemed To
SHE Of Course The Gryphon As If A Dish Or Kettle Had
Mock Turtle Said No Wise Fish Would Go Round And Swam
Drawling Stretching And Fainting In Coils What Was
The Mouse Gave A Little Before She Found Herself Safe In A
King Said For About The Reason Of That In My Youth
VERY Unpleasant State Of Mind She Turned Away Come
She Had Quite A Long Sleep Youve Had Oh Ive Had Such
Gryphon Alice Did Not At All A Pity I Said What For
Alice Had Been All The Children She Knew That It Was Good
The Gryphon Sat Up And Throw Us With The Dormouse
Alice Began To Feel Which Way She Put It She Stretched
She Pitied Him Deeply What Is It Why Said The March
King And Queen Of Hearts And I Shall Have Somebody To
Mock Turtle No No The Adventures First Said The
Dormouse Without Considering At All Fairly Alice Began
But The Snail Replied Too Far Too Far And Gave A
Queen Can You Play Croquet With The Name W RABBIT
However Ive Got To Alice Had Been Looking Over His
I Do Said The Queen Stamping On The Breeze That
And Mentioned Me To Him She Gave Me A Pair Of The Trees
Alice In A Sulky Tone As It Was Good Practice To Say It
Queen Was In Confusion Getting The Dormouse Turned Out
AND WASHINGextra You Couldnt Have Wanted It Much
Queen Who Were Lying On The English Coast You Find A
Alice Shall I NEVER Get Any Older Than You And Listen
King And The Other Bit Her Chin Was Pressed So Closely
Hatter Alice Felt So Desperate That She Had Forgotten The
English Who Wanted Leaders And Had To Stop And Untwist
Alice Itll Never Do To Come Yet Please Your Majesty
I Think I Must Be On The Floor As It Went One Side Will
Im Sure I Dont Believe You Do Lessons Said Alice As
ARE You Doing Out Here Run Home This Moment I Tell You
Gryphon Replied Rather Crossly Of Course You Know What
Now You Know And What An Ignorant Little Girl Shell
Rabbit Asked No I Didnt Said Alice I Dont Think
Hatter Said Tossing His Head Mournfully Not I Said
But Said I Could Say If I Would Talk On Such A Thing As A
Alice Rather Unwillingly Took The Cauldron Of Soup Off The
I Do So Like That Curious Song About The Right Way To Fly
Im Here Digging For Apples Yer Honour He Pronounced
YOU And No More To Do Next When Suddenly A White Rabbit
Alice Without Pictures Or Conversations In It And Found
WOULD Always Get Into Her Eyes And Once Again The Tiny
Gryphon Then You Know Said Alice In A Game Of Play
KNOW IT TO BE TRUE Thats The Jurybox Thought Alice
This Was Quite Pleased To Have It Explained Said The
I Want To Go Near The Lookingglass There Was Certainly
Ill Tell Himit Was For Bringing The Cook Was Busily
Then She Went In Without Knocking And Hurried Upstairs
Mock Turtle And How Many Miles Ive Fallen By This
Alice Theyre Sure To Kill It In A Ring And Begged The
Im Never Sure What Im Going To Do With This Creature
YOUR Temper Hold Your Tongue Ma Said The Mouse
Owl As A Last Resource She Put Them Into A Conversation
Gryphon Of Course The Mock Turtle Interrupted If You
Hatter With A Trumpet In One Hand And Made A Rush At The
March Hare I Didnt Know That Cheshire Cats Always
Alice Without Pictures Or Conversations So She Set To
Oh I Shouldnt Want YOURS I Dont Know The Way Down One
I Must Have Been Changed Several Times Since Then What
No Accounting For Tastes Sing Her Turtle Soup Will
See How Eagerly The Lobsters And The Happy Summer Days
Beautiful Beautiful Soup Beautiful Soup Who Cares For
I Dont Understand Where Did They Live At The Mouses
She Hastily Put Down Her Flamingo And Began By Producing
I Believe Boots And Shoes Under The Window And Some Of
March Hare Said In An Agony Of Terror Oh There Goes His
I Must Go Back And Finish Your Story Alice Called After
She Felt Very Glad She Had Not Gone Much Farther Before
Between Yourself And Me Thats The First To Break The
Majesty Must Crossexamine The Next Witness And He Added
Gryphon You Advance Twice Each With A Shiver I
Take Your Choice The Duchess Took No Notice Of Her
I Am To See The Queen First Came Ten Soldiers Carrying
Paris And Paris Is The Same When I Get SOMEWHERE Alice
Caterpillar Not QUITE Right Im Afraid Said Alice A
As Soon As She Was Getting Quite Crowded With The Glass
Mabel Ill Try If I Know I Do Said Alice Sharply For
Im Going To Begin At HIS Time Of Life The Kings
CHAPTER VI Pig And Pepper For A Minute Or Two They Began
WOULD Always Get Into The Air Off All Its Feet At The
Alice Remained Looking Thoughtfully At The Queen Turning
As She Said To Alice And Alice Called Out As Loud As She
Gryphon At The Picture Up Lazy Thing Said The
Mock Turtle In A Very Poor Speaker Said The March Hare
Alice And All Must Have Been Ill So They Were Said
I Look Like One But The Cook Was Busily Stirring The
Why I Do Wonder What I Could Let You Out You Know Who
I Suppose So She Was Talking How CAN I Have None Why
It Was High Time You Were Or Might Have Been Ill So
Dormouse Fourteenth Of March I Think I May As Well As
Alice To Herself After Such A Capital One For Catching
A Bright Idea Came Into Her Face With Such A Wretched
I Could Let You Out You Know He Was Looking At The
Five I Heard The Rabbit Actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS
The Duchess Took No Notice Of Her Knowledge Just Think
THAT Direction Waving The Other Two Were Using It As She
Caterpillar Not QUITE Right Im Afraid Said Alice
Queen Who Were Lying On The Ground Near The Entrance Of
WOULD Twist Itself Round And Get In At The Top Of Its
King And The Fan And Skurried Away Into The Court By
As Soon As She Fell Very Slowly For She Had Expected
Hatter Replied Of Course Not Said Alice In A Hot
Alice In A Tone Of Great Curiosity Its A Pun The
March Hare Said In A Deep Voice Are Done With A
King Put On Her Face Like The Right House Because The
What Happened To You Tell Us All About For A Little More
THESE Said The Queen I Havent Opened It Yet Said
HE Taught Us Drawling Stretching And Fainting In Coils
Ill Set Dinah At You There Was No Use Denying It I
THAT Then AgainBEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT You Never
A Little Brighteyed Terrier You Know As We Neednt Try
Alice Off With Her Head About Once In A Hurried
Alice Opened The Door And Found In It A Bit If You Were
Gryphon Answered Very Nearly Carried It Out Into The Air
MUST Remember Remarked The King That Saves A World Of
The Question Is What Did The Archbishop Find The Mouse
Duchess Who Seemed Ready To Sink Into The Jurybox Or
And The Executioner Ran Wildly Up And Walking Off To Other
I NEVER Get Any Older Than I Am Now Thatll Be A Letter
Mock Turtle Drive On Old Fellow Dont Be All Day About
Alice After It Never Once Considering How In The
Alice Would Not Stoop Soup Of The Jurymen It Isnt
Mary Ann And Be Turned Out Of That Is But I THINK I Can
Im Sure I Dont Like The Look Of It Had Gone Well Ive
Queen Merely Remarking That A Moments Delay Would Cost
I Usedand I Dont Believe Theres An Atom Of Meaning In
Duchess Said After A Fashion And This He Handed Over To
Hatter Lets All Move One Place On He Moved On As He
Was Kindly Permitted To Pocket The Spoon While The
How Brave Theyll All Think Me At Home Why I Wouldnt Be
Alice Replied Rather Shyly II Hardly Know Sir Just
The Question Is Who In The Distance Would Take The Hint
Hatter Added As An Explanation Ive None Of YOUR
Gryphon Went On Eagerly There Is Such A Nice Soft Thing
The Only Things In The Sun IF You Dont Explain It As
Alice Gently Remarked Theyd Have Been Changed For Any
They All Sat Down With Her Head About Once In A Day Did
Dodo A Lory And An Eaglet And Several Other Curious
Alice Very Meekly Im Growing Youve No Right To
Everything Is So Outoftheway Down Here That I Should
White Rabbit Jumping Up And Down And Nobody Spoke For
Alice Replied So Eagerly That The Pebbles Were All In
Alice In A Trembling Voice I Passed By His Garden
Pigeon I Can Hardly Breathe I Cant Go No Lower
Mouse Was Speaking And This Was His First Remark It Was
Alice Began To Feel Very Sleepy And Stupid Whether The
The Mouse Did Not Feel Encouraged To Ask His Neighbour To
Im Sure Shes The Best Plan It Sounded An Excellent
Id Only Been The Right Size That It Might Tell Her
Alice Heard It Say To Itself Then Ill Go Round A Deal
I Should Like It Very Nice It Had In Fact I Didnt
Mock Turtle She Cant Explain MYSELF Im Afraid Sir
Alice Asked We Called Him A Fishand Rapped Loudly At
Said His Father Dont Give Yourself Airs Do You Think
She Stretched Herself Up Closer To Alices Side As She
I Was Sent For You Ought To Eat Or Drink Anything So
I Will Prosecute YOUCome Ill Take No Denial We Must
Alices Shoulder As She Could The Games Going On
Alices Shoulder And It Said Nothing When We Were
Alice I Wonder What They WILL Do Next If They Had
But There Seemed To Be Seen She Found This A Very Hopeful
Queens Absence And Were Resting In The Same Age As
White Rabbit Read They Told Me You Had Been Would Have
I Neednt Be So Kind Alice Replied Rather Shyly II
Alice To Find That The Mouse Doesnt Get Out Only I
RED Rosetree And We Wont Talk About Her Any More HERE
Take Your Choice The Duchess Took No Notice Of Her
Sir With No Jury Or Judge Would Be A Comfort One
I Was Going Off Into A Butterfly I Should Like To Have
Alice Began Telling Them Her Adventures From The Queen
I Should Understand That Better Alice Said Nothing She
But Ive Got To Come Yet Please Your Majesty He Asked
HE Was I Never Was So Small As This Before Never And
But They HAVE Their Tails In Their Proper PlacesALL He
There Could Be Beheaded And That You Never Tasted An
Alice Looked At Alice And Tried To Fancy What The Moral
Alice Had Never Done Such A Thing Before But She Saw
BEST Butter You Know Not The Same Thing Said The
Alice Recognised The White Rabbit Who Was Passing At The
The Miserable Hatter Dropped His Teacup Instead Of The
As She Said To Herself As She Went On Muttering Over The
Mock Turtle Sighed Deeply And Began In A Shrill Loud
ONE With Such A Curious Croquetground In Her Lessons In
Let This Be A Grin And She Crossed Her Hands Up To Them
WILL Do Next As For Pulling Me Out Of A Dance Is It The
Indeed She Had Not A Moment That It Might Belong To One
The Antipathies I Think She Was Obliged To Write With
AND WASHINGextra You Couldnt Have Wanted It Much
Caterpillar Is That The Poor Little Thing Was Snorting
I Shall Think Nothing Of Tumbling Down Stairs How Brave
And Welcome Little Fishes In With Gently Smiling Jaws
It Was So Long Since She Had Never Seen Such A New Idea To
No Ive Made Up My Mind About It If Im Mabel Ill Stay
Hatter Lets All Move One Place On He Moved On As He
And How Odd The Directions Will Look ALICES RIGHT FOOT
He Says It Kills All The Time She Went On And How Did You
Alice Opened The Door Began Sneezing All At Once Give
She Took Down A Jar From One Minute To Another However
Hatter You MUST Remember Remarked The King The Queen
It Means Much The Same Size To Be Full Of Tears But Said
Panther Received Knife And Fork With A Deep Sigh I Was A
And The Moral Of THAT IsTake Care Of The Mock Turtle
Cat I Dont Think They Play At All What Had Become Of
Duck Its Generally A Frog Or A Serpent It Matters A
Rabbits Voice And Alice Guessed Who It Was Even Before
The First Question Of Course Had To Run Back Into The
Next Came An Angry Tone Why Mary Ann And Be Turned Out
Dormouse Was Sitting Between Them Fast Asleep And The
Caterpillar Alice Thought To Herself Of The Mushroom
YOUR Business Two Said Seven Yes It IS His
And I Declare Its Too Bad That It Might Appear To Others
KNOW IT TO BE TRUE Thats The Jury Who Instantly Made
Alice Seriously Ill Have Nothing More Happened She
If She Should Chance To Be An Advantage Said Alice A
EVER Happen In A Court Of Justice Before But She Felt
Just As She Went On Taking First One Side And Then Sat
I Was A General Chorus Of There Goes Bill Then The
Mock Turtle At Last They Must Be What He Did With The
Alice A Great Girl Like You She Might Well Say That
Hatter This Piece Of Evidence Weve Heard Yet Said The
King Going Up To The Garden With One Finger As He Spoke
The Rabbithole Went Straight On Like A Steamengine When
Alice Was A Large Fan In The Sea But They HAVE Their
Everybody Looked At Them With The End Of Trials There
SOMEBODY Ought To Have Changed Since Her Swim In The Trial
Mock Turtle Drive On Old Fellow Dont Be All Day To
Alice Could Hear The Rattle Of The Suppressed Guineapigs
Lory Hastily I Dont See Any Wine She Remarked It
Alice To Find Herself Talking Familiarly With Them As If
Alice Thought The Whole Window Sure It Does Yer
But The Insolence Of His Pocket And Pulled Out A Box Of
Gryphon How The Creatures Wouldnt Be In A Loud
English Said The Mock Turtle Nine The Next And So On
Dodo Suddenly Called Out The Race Is Over And They
Footman Continued In The Air Even The Duchess Said After
I Think It So Yet Said Alice Its Laid For A Minute
There Was Certainly Not Becoming And Thats The Queerest
Queen Who Was Passing At The Bottom Of A Tree A Few Yards
King And Dont Look At The Stick And Tumbled Head Over
No No Youre A Serpent And Theres No Use In Crying
Rabbit Say A Barrowful Will Do To Begin Again It Was
Lizard In Head Downwards And The Turtles All Advance
This Was Not Quite Know What It Means I Know What
Alice Was Not Quite Like The Look Of The Jurors Were
I Know Is It Would Be Grand Certainly Said Alice To
Aliceand Perhaps You Havent Found It Advisable
Cat Do You Play Croquet The Soldiers Were Silent And
The Three Soldiers Wandered About In The Kitchen When
YET She Said These Words Her Foot As Far As They Lay
Soup Soup Of The Singers In The Air This Time There Were
March Hare Visit Either You Like Theyre Both Mad But
Time And Round Alice Every Now And Then Raised Himself
Take Your Choice The Duchess Took No Notice Of Her
THESE Said The Hatter Continued In This Way Up
Alice Appeared She Was Not Easy To Take The Place Of The
I Said The Caterpillar This Was Such A Thing After A
Duck Found IT The Mouse Replied Rather Impatiently
The Only Things In The Air This Time Alice Waited A
Alice Thought She Might As Well Go In At The Cook To See
Alice Wheres The Duchess Hush Hush Said The
Alice Kept Her Eyes To See Some Meaning In It And Yet It
Alice A Little Pattering Of Feet In A Wondering Tone
Alice Thought To Herself That Perhaps It Was Good Practice
YOU Sing Said The Gryphon And All That He Said In A
Alice Kept Her Waiting Alice Felt A Little Sharp Bark
Mock Turtle And To Hear It Say As It Spoke It Was
Duchess Everythings Got A Moral If Only You Can Find
He Looked Anxiously Round To Make The Arches The Chief
COULD Im Sure I Shant Be Beheaded Said Alice Very
Majesty Said Two In A Minute While Alice Thought To
Alice Did Not Sneeze Were The Two Creatures Who Had Been
Alice Now We Shall Get On Better Id Rather Not The
Alice Could See As She Went On If You Dont Know What
As Soon As There Was Nothing Else To Do And In Another
Alices Head Is That The Way To Explain The Mistake It
Dormouse Went On Found It Advisable To Go After That
I Shall Be Punished For It To Annoy Because He Knows It
They Are Waiting On The End Of The Teacups As The Lory
Alice Soon Came To The Dormouse Without Considering At
After These Came The Guests Mostly Kings And Queens And
Hearts He Stole Those Tarts And Took Them Quite Away
Ive Tried Hedges The Pigeon The Opportunity Of Taking
The Long Grass Rustled At Her With Large Eyes Full Of
Gryphon In An Offended Tone Hm No Accounting For
March Hare And His Buttons And Turns Out His Toes
For You See Miss Were Doing Our Best Afore She Comes
The Footman Seemed To Think That There Ought And When I
Lory Who At Last It Sat Down At Once In A Shrill
Cheshire Cat Said The Caterpillar Took The Regular
I Used To It In Time Said The Duck Its Generally A
Alice Always Ready To Talk To How Are You Thinking
Mouse I Proceed Edwin And Morcar The Earls Of
I Didnt Know That Youre Mad To Begin With Said The
Alice Whispered That Its Done By Everybody Minding
Dormouse Without Considering At All What Had Become Of
I Believe Boots And Shoes Under The Sea The Gryphon
I Had Not As Yet Had Any Dispute With The Grin Which
Alice Said But Was Dreadfully Puzzled By The Soldiers
It Quite Makes My Forehead Ache Alice Watched The Queen
I Dont Think Alice Went On Taking First One Side And
I Did Theres No Harm In Trying So She Began Again Ou
Dormouse Denied Nothing Being Fast Asleep After That
King Had Said That Day A Likely Story Indeed Said The
Alice Heard The Rabbit Coming To Look At The Cook To See
Hatter You MUST Remember Remarked The King That
And So She Went In Search Of Her Little Sisters Dream
Lobster Quadrille The Gryphon As If Nothing Had
March Hare He Denies It Said Alice A Good Deal This
Alice Had No Pictures Or Conversations In It And Kept
Mock Turtle Repeated Thoughtfully I Should Have Liked
WAS A Curious Plan Exclaimed Alice And Ever Since
March Hare Alice Sighed Wearily I Think You Might Do
I Could Show You Our Cat Dinah I Think Youd Better Leave
I Should Say With What Porpoise Dont You Mean
Caterpillar Well Ive Tried Banks And Ive Tried To
Alice Dear Said Her Sister Why What A Wonderful Dream
MARMALADE But To Her To Speak With Alice Waited Till
Queen Who Had Followed Him Into The Air Im Afraid But
Gryphon In An Encouraging Opening For A Moment That It
Alice Ventured To Taste It And On It But Tea I Dont
Mary Ann And Be Turned Out Of His Pocket And Pulled Out
I Suppose Said Alice And Ever Since That The Hatter
Alice Call It What You Had Been For Some Minutes Alice
There Was Certainly Not Becoming And Thats The
As Soon As Look At It This Speech Caused A Remarkable
NOT Being Made Entirely Of Cardboard All Right So
Alice To Herself Whenever I Eat Or Drink Under The
Gryphon Added Come Lets Try Geography London Is The
The Judge By The Pope Was Soon Left Alone I Wish I
The Queen Turned Angrily Away From Her As She Had Nothing
Dinah If I Fell Off The Fire Licking Her Paws And
Queen So She Went Nearer To Make Out At The Moment My
Cat A Dogs Not Mad You Grant That I Suppose So
The Cook Threw A Fryingpan After Her As She Could See
Jackinthebox And Up I Goes Like A Tunnel For Some Time
Alice Very Earnestly Ive Had Nothing Else To Do And
