Follow these steps to run the systems:

1. Open the SENG3130A1.sln file in Visual Studio (the 2017 edition was used to develop the system).
2. Using the project targeter in the menu at the top center of the screen, select which system you would like to run.
3. Click the Start button, and the system will launch.
4. If the system is interactive, the window will ask you for input. If the system is not interactive, the window will close when it is finished.
5. You can then review the output in the root folder as output.txt.

For non-interactive systems, the system will read an input file from the root folder.
To use a different input file, simply replace the input.txt file inside the root folder with your desired input file.

NB. To review debug information, simply alter the target mode from Release to Debug, which will then print debug information as the system completes its stages.
