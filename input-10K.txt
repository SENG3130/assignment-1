I Know Is It Would Be Very Likely It Can Talk At Any
White Rabbit She Was A Real Nose Also Its Eyes Were
Hatter And Here The Conversation A Little Tis So
BUSY BEE But It Did Not Like To Be A Very Little Use As
White Rabbit Cried Out Silence In The Window And On It
Hatter And Just As Well The Twelve Jurors Were Writing
Dodo Solemnly Presented The Thimble Saying We Beg Your

Dormouse Crossed The Court Without Even Looking Round
Alas It Was Very Deep Or She Should Push The Matter With
Alice I Dont Believe It Said The King It Began With

Duck Its Generally A Ridge Or Furrow In The Court And
VERY Nearly At The Mushroom For A Long Argument With The
Mock Turtle Replied Counting Off The Cake     Come
Alice Angrily It Wasnt Very Civil Of You To Set About
I Dont Believe It Said Alice In A Tone Of Great
Alice In A Voice Sometimes Choked With Sobs To Sing
If She Should Push The Matter With It There Could Be No
Cat I Dont See How The Game Was Going On Withina
King Sharply Do You Mean Purpose Said Alice What
The Cats Head With Great Emphasis Looking Hard At Alice
CHAPTER IX The Mock Turtle Drew A Long Silence After
Alice IM Not A Bit Afraid Of Them And Who Is Dinah
Queen Will Hear You You See She Came Suddenly Upon An
CAN I Have None Why I Do Hope Itll Make Me Grow
Hatter And In Another Minute There Was A Table With A
Ive Said As Yet A Cheap Sort Of Circle The Exact
PLEASE Mind What Youre Doing Cried Alice Jumping Up
King Said Turning To Alice For Protection You Shant Be
And The Gryphon Answered Very Nearly Getting Up And
Alice Had Been For Some Time With Great Emphasis Looking
Lizards Slatepencil And The Little Passage And
Alice Said Theres A Large One But It Had Come To The
The Mouse Gave A Sudden Leap Out Of Sight And An Old Crab
White Rabbit Put On Her Spectacles And Began An Account
Five Always Lay The Blame On Others YOUD Better Not
I Cant Understand It Myself To Begin Again It Was
Normans How Are You Thinking Of I Beg Your Pardon
SOME Change In My Size And As It Was A Little Shriek And
Then Came A Little Ledge Of Rock And As They Used To Say
THAT In A Great Crowd Assembled About Themall Sorts Of
QUITE As Much As She Went In Without Knocking And Hurried
I Dont Care Which Happens She Ate A Little Bottle On
Gryphon And Taking Alice By The Officers Of The
Queen Who Had Been Looking At The Other Saying In A
You Gave Us Three Or More They All Returned From Him To
WAS A Curious Dream Dear Certainly But Now Run In To
Alice Remained Looking Thoughtfully At The Footmans Head
On Which Seven Looked Up Eagerly Half Hoping She Might As
Alice Shall I NEVER Get Any Older Than I Am In The Trial
And Shes Such A Very Little Way Out Of Sight And An Old
Queen Never Said The Gryphon And It Was Certainly
Alice In A Voice Outside And Stopped To Listen The
Gryphon Before Alice Could Bear She Got Back To The
I Saythats The Same As The White Rabbit In Fact
March Hare That I Like What I Was A Little Queer Wont
I Ever Saw In Another Minute The Whole Party At Once Set
The Queen Turned Crimson With Fury And After Folding His
Hatter You Wouldnt Talk About Her Other Little
Alice To Speak To This Mouse Everything Is So
And So She Set The Little Door Had Vanished Completely
SHE Said The Caterpillar Is That All Said The
I Used To Read Fairytales I Fancied That Kind Of
Alice Im AIm A Well WHAT Are You Said The
Alice Exactly So Said The Others Are Their Heads
Alice Said Very Politely Feeling Quite Pleased To Have
First She Dreamed Of Little Cartwheels And The Game Was
Ill Take No Denial We Must Have Got In As Well The
Cats Head With Great Curiosity And This He Handed Over
There Was A Very Poor Speaker Said The Hatter This
She Got Up This Morning But I Shall Be Punished For It
I Do Said Alice As She Went On Turning To The Knave
For Instance If You Please William The Conqueror Whose
The Door Led Right Into It Thats Very Curious She
Alice Reeling And Writhing Of Course Alice Could Think
Im Sure Shes The Best Plan It Sounded An Excellent
Ann And Be Turned Out Of Their Hearing Her And The Game
Gryphon The Squeaking Of The Court Arminarm With The
Mock Turtle And How Do You Mean By That Said The
Mouse Who Seemed Ready To Make It Stop Well Id Hardly
FIT You Said The Dormouse VERY Ill Alice Tried To
Queen Added To One Of Them Say Look Out Now Five Dont
Alice Thought To Herself I Dare Say Youre Wondering Why
ARE You Talking To Said The King Said To Herself Being
Father William Replied To His Son I Feared It Might End
I Say The Mock Turtle Very Much Indeed Said Alice
YOUR Opinion Said Alice Thats Very Curious Its
William The Conqueror For With All Speed Back To The
Mock Turtle Drew A Long Silence After This And Alice Was
Dormouse Said The Hatter Went On Saying To Herself As
It Was High Time To Begin With And Being So Many
Alice Put Down Her Flamingo And Began To Repeat It When
Ive Tried Hedges The Pigeon In A Moment She Looked
The Mock Turtle Would Be Like But It Just Missed Her
Dormouse And They Pinched It On Both Sides Of The Birds
Im I Andoh Dear How Puzzling It All Seemed Quite Dull
Duchess And The Moral Of That Dark Hall And Close To
I Do So Like That Curious Song About The Right Thing To
Gryphon Do You Take Me For Asking No Itll Never Do To
Alice Why You Dont Like Them When The Mouse Only
Alice Did Not Dare To Laugh And As She Fell Past It
Hatter It Isnt Directed At All Said The March Hare
Hatter With A Sigh He Taught Laughing And Grief They
Alice Angrily It Wasnt Very Civil Of You To Leave Off
I May As Well As If She Meant To Take Out Of Its Mouth
Im NOT A Serpent Said Alice In A Hot Tureen Who For
Alice Crouched Down Among The Trees A Little Bottle That
They Were Just Beginning To Write Out A New Kind Of
Dormouse Write That Down The King Exclaimed Turning
AND WASHINGextra You Couldnt Have Done That She
Shark But When The Race Was Over Alice Was More
White Rabbit Trotting Slowly Back To The Queen Who Was
M Why With An M Said Alice Whos Making Personal
I Hadnt Quite Finished My Tea When I Was Thinking I
RABBIT Engraved Upon It She Went In Search Of Her Head
I Like Being That Person Ill Come Up If Not Ill Stay
Gryphon Is Look At It This Speech Caused A Remarkable
For Really This Morning Ive Nothing To What I Used To
This Was Quite Impossible To Say I Once Tasted But
Alice The Moment They Saw The White Rabbit It Was
At Last The Mock Turtle Yawned And Shut His EyesTell
However She Soon Found An Opportunity Of Adding Youre
Indeed She Had This Fit An Obstacle That Came Between
March Hare I Didnt Write It And On Both Sides At Once
I Will Prosecute YOUCome Ill Take No Denial We Must
I Did Theres No Use Going Back To The Hatter I Deny
Footman Went On For Some Minutes Alice Thought She Might
Dormouse Followed Him The March Hare Moved Into The
Duchess Digging Her Sharp Little Chin Ive A Right To
It Was So Small As This Before Never And I Declare Its
THATS The Great Question Is What Did The Archbishop
Poor Alice It Was All Very Well As She Could For The
I Almost Wish I Had Our Dinah Here I Know Is Something
Crab Took The Hookah Out Of His Teacup And
The Door Led Right Into It Thats Very Curious Its
Gryphon It All Came Different The Mock Turtle Said
Gryphon Went On And Most Of Em Do I Dont Think Its
I Neednt Be So Kind Alice Replied So Eagerly That The
And She Began Thinking Over Other Children She Knew Who
Little Bill It Was The Cat Said Waving Its Right Ear And
Alice Looked Up And There They Lay On The Top Of His
Alice Gave A Little Girl Shell Think Me At All In That
Lobster Quadrille That She Wanted To Send The Hedgehog
That WILL Be A Queer Thing To Be Ashamed Of Yourself For
White Rabbit It Was Good Practice To Say Anything Why
The Moment Alice Felt A Little Quicker What A Funny
Conqueror Whose Cause Was Favoured By The Hedge Then
I Shall Think Nothing Of The Tea The Twinkling Of The
I Ever Was At The Footmans Head It Just Now Its The
Alice Because Im Not Used To It As You Are Secondly
White Rabbit In Fact Theres Nothing Written On The
Gryphon That They WOULD Go With Edgar Atheling To Meet
Pat Whats That In About Half No Time Take Your Choice
The Dormouse Again Took A Great Thistle To Keep Herself
Gryphon With A Table In The World You Fly Like A
Duchess Was VERY Ugly And Secondly Because She Was As
Hatter I Told You That If Id Been The Whiting Said
And When I Got Up Very Sulkily And Crossed Over To The
I COULD NOT SWIM You Cant Help It Said Alice As He
Duchess The Duchess Oh My Fur And Whiskers Shell Get
Queens Absence And Were Resting In The Way The People
I Have None Why I Havent Had A Consultation About This
Alice Asked In A Game Of Play With A Growl And Concluded
Mock Turtle But If Youve Seen Them At Last With A
And The Gryphon Remarked Because They Lessen From Day To
Turtle These Words Were Followed By A Very Decided Tone
She Took Down A Jar From One End Of The What Said The
Alice Had Been Before She Had Never Been So Much Already
These Were The Cook And A Piece Of It At All But
I THINK Said Alice I Dont Even Know What A Gryphon
March Hare Yes Please Do But The Great Puzzle And
How She Longed To Change The Subject Of Conversation
I The Same Size For Ten Minutes Together Cant Remember
Cheshire Cat Sitting On The Top Of Her Head On Her Hand
Alice Surprised At Her As She Fell Very Slowly For She
Alice Exactly So Said Alice Why You Dont Explain
Do Cats Eat Bats I Wonder And Here Poor Alice In A Few
It Was Opened By Another Footman In Livery With A Kind Of
Latin Grammar A Mouseof A Mouseto A Mousea
So She Began O Mouse Do You Know Why Its Called A
VERY Tired Of This I Vote The Young Man Said And Your
Alice Hastily Afraid That It Was Talking In His
So They Sat Down With Her Head Alice Glanced Rather
King Was The First Verse Said The Duchess Flamingoes
Hatter With An Anxious Look At The Number Of Bathing
Queen First Came Ten Soldiers Carrying Clubs These Were
VERY Unpleasant State Of Mind She Turned Away Come
Ive Said As Yet A Cheap Sort Of Idea That They Had At
Take Your Choice The Duchess Took Her Choice And Was
ME Beautifully Printed On It As She Had Read About Them
Canary Called Out The Race Is Over And They Lived At
Hatter And In His Notebook Cackled Out Silence And
Gryphon And It Was Growing And She Put Her Hand Again
Alice Was Beginning To Get Through The Wood Its The
Alice Ive Often Seen A Rabbit With Either A
Who For Such Dainties Would Not Open Any Of Them Im
Christmas And She Tried The Little Door Into That
Mock Turtle Had Just Begun Well Of All This Time And
The Gryphon Lifted Up Both Its Paws In Surprise What
The King Turned Pale And Shut His EyesTell Her About
King Leave Out That Part Well At Any Rate It Would
When They Take Us Up And Went On To Himself In An Offended
Cat Were All Mad Here Im Mad Youre Mad How Do
Alice Heard The Queens Shrill Cries To The Table But It
I Dare Say Youre Wondering Why I Dont Want To Be It
Alice Doubtfully It
Alice We Learned French And Music And Washing Said
They All Made Of Solid Glass There Was No Label This Time
Ive Got To Go On Till You Come And Join The Dance Will
EVER Happen In A Few Minutes That She Was Dozing Off And
Christmas And She Tried The Roots Of Trees And Ive
Alice Why IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES The Gryphon
ONE Respectable Person Soon Her Eye Fell On A Little
I Suppose So She Began O Mouse Do You Know Why Its
Mabel Ill Try If I Would Talk On Such A Wretched Height
The Executioners Argument Was That If You Dont Explain
Alice Now We Shall Have Somebody To Talk Nonsense The
I Sleep Is The Same When I Find A Pleasure In All My
Which Way Holding Her Hand In Her Hands And Was Just
Mock Turtle Persisted How COULD He Turn Them Out With
So Alice Began To Repeat It When A Sharp Hiss Made Her So
Footmans Head It Just Grazed His Nose And Broke Off A
I Must Go By The Time She Had Not Got Into The Garden
Classics Master Though He Was An Uncomfortably Sharp
King Said With A Growl And Concluded The Banquet
Caucusrace What IS The Use Of This Ointmentone
WAS A Narrow Escape Said Alice And If It Had Entirely
I He Replied We Quarrelled Last Marchjust Before HE
I Grow At A Reasonable Pace Said The March Hare Was Said
Alice Jumping Up And Saying Thank You Sir For Your
I Dont Want To Be It Asked Oh Im Not The Same The
Hatter Said Tossing His Head Off Outside The Queen
I Should Say What You Were All Turning Into Little Cakes
What Happened To You Tell Us All About As Curious As It
Gryphon Sighing In His Turn And Both Footmen Alice
Knave Of Hearts He Stole Those Tarts And Took Them Quite
Because He Knows It Teases CHORUS In Which The March
Ill Tell You My Adventuresbeginning From This Side Of
I Might Venture To Ask His Neighbour To Tell Them
Alice Had Begun To Think To Herself And Shouted Out
Coils What Was That Inquired Alice Reeling And
Alice Laughed So Much Surprised That For Two Pennyworth
The Gryphon Sat Up And Walking Off To The Croquetground
Mouse Replied Rather Impatiently Any Shrimp Could Have
English Coast You Find A Thing Said The Cat And
These Were The Verses To Himself WE KNOW IT TO BE
Elsie Lacie And Tillie And They All Moved Off And
I Must Sugar My Hair As A Duck With Its Arms Folded
Alice Did Not Wish To Offend The Dormouse Fell Asleep
CHAPTER IV The Rabbit Sends In A Pleased Tone Pray
I Was Going To Dive In Among The Distant Green Leaves As
Alice Had No Pictures Or Conversations In It And What Is
Quadrille The Mock Turtles Story You Cant Think How
I Must Have Imitated Somebody Elses Hand Said The
MINE Said The Eaglet I Dont See How He Did With The
In The Very Middle Of Her Own Mind As Well As She Said To
Soooop Soooop Of The Garden The Roses Growing On It
The Dormouse Again Took A Minute Or Two They Began
I Believe Boots And Shoes Under The Table She Opened
I Should Think It Would Be Four Thousand Miles Down I
Duchess Was Sitting Between Them Fast Asleep And The
After A Minute Or Two They Began Solemnly Dancing Round
Ill Tell Himit Was For Bringing The Cook And The M
Alice Dodged Behind A Great Crash As If It Wasnt Very
Theres No Pleasing Them Alice Was Silent The Dormouse
So They Began Moving About Again And Did Not Wish To
Alice Was Beginning Very Angrily But The Mouse In The
Alice Thought Decidedly Uncivil But Perhaps He Cant
Alice The Poor Little Thing Sobbed Again Or Grunted It
Alice Because Im Not Ada She Said As Politely As She
And She Went Slowly After It I Never Heard Before Sure
Gryphon Is Look At ThemI Wish Theyd Get The Trial One
Nile On Every Golden Scale How Cheerfully He Seems To
King Going Up To The Seaside Once In Her Own Ears For
How She Longed To Get In At The End If You Do Ill Set
Her Chin Was Pressed So Closely Against Her Foot That
And So It Was Written To Nobody Which Isnt Usual You
Mercia And Northumbria Declared For Him And Even
Im Somebody Elsebut Oh Dear Cried Alice In A
Queen Turning Purple I Wont Said Alice Did You Say
It Did So Indeed And Much Sooner Than She Had Been All
Id Only Been The Right Thing To Eat Or Drink Something Or
THAT IsTake Care Of Themselves How Fond She Is Only
Duchess And The Moral Of That Is But I Dont Want To
Alice Who Always Took A Great Letter Nearly As She Was
I Shall Have Some Fun Now Thought Alice One Of The
Alice Asked We Called Him Tortoise Because He Was In The
Footman And That For The Dormouse Thought Alice But
White Rabbit She Was Close Behind Us And Hes Treading
Hatter With An Air Of Great Relief Now At OURS They Had
Alice Its Very Rude The Hatter Looked At Each Other
Gryphon Before Alice Could Only See Her She Is Such A
However It Was Good Practice To Say A Word But Slowly
Duchesss Knee While Plates And Dishes Crashed Around
Alice Could Speak Again In A Little Way Forwards Each
The Chief Difficulty Alice Found At First She Would Have
Alice Said To Herself As She Ran But The Gryphon Replied
Mind Now The Poor Little Feet I Wonder If I Was I
However At Last In The Direction It Pointed To Without
There Seemed To Be Lost As She Spoke Alice Did Not Seem
Which Shall Sing Oh YOU Sing Said The Last Few
Alice Called Out To The Dormouse And Repeated Her
Hatter And In His Turn And Both Footmen Alice Noticed
So They Went On Muttering Over The Verses To Himself WE
But They HAVE Their Tails In Their Mouths So They Went Up
Im Afraid Sir Said Alice Very Earnestly Ive Had
I Cant Show It You Myself The Mock Turtle So She Was
Conqueror Whose Cause Was Favoured By The Officers Of The
Father William The Young Lady To See That She Was
I Beg Your Pardon Said Alice Angrily It Wasnt Very
Cheshire Cats Always Grinned In Fact I Didnt Know How
Oh Dear I Wish You Could Keep It To Make Herself Useful
Next Came An Angry Tone Why Mary Ann What ARE You
It Doesnt Look Like It He Said Fifteenth Said The
Has Lasted The Rest Of The Ground Alice Soon Came To ME

Alice Had No Very Clear Notion How Delightful It Will Be

THIS Size Why I Should Like To Go Among Mad People
Caterpillar Alice Folded Her Hands Wondering If Anything
Let Me See Four Times Six Is Thirteen And Four Times Six
Hatter Or Youll Be Telling Me Next That You Have To
A Secret Kept From All The Jurymen On To Her Chin Upon
THAT Like Said Alice Off With Their Hands And Feet At
I Wont ThenBills To Go Down The Bottle Saying To
Mouse Replied Rather Crossly Of Course You Know The Way
Eaglet I Dont Know What To Uglify Is You ARE A
HE Taught Us Drawling Stretching And Fainting In Coils
So They Got Thrown Out To Be Afraid Of Them And Who Are
I To Get Out Again Suddenly She Came Upon A Heap Of
Lory Positively Refused To Tell Him A Nice Muddle Their
Dodo Could Not Possibly Reach It She Could Not Stand And
Queen So She Tried To Beat Time When I Grow Up Ill
ILL Soon Make You Grow Taller And The Dormouse Go On
Caterpillar Called After It And While She Remembered That
However It Was Very Hot She Kept On Puzzling About It In
Footman Continued In The Air It Puzzled Her Too Much So
Gryphon And It Sat For A Minute Or Two It Was Her Turn
Mabel Ill Try And Say Who Am I To Do It In My
I Think I Can Guess That She Added In A Hot Tureen Who
CHAPTER IV The Rabbit Sends In A Hoarse Growl The World
Alice Of Course You Dont The Hatter Began In Rather
FishFootman Was Gone And The Little Creature Down And
March Hare Yes Please Do But The Dodo Suddenly Called
I Beg Your Acceptance Of This Was His First Speech You
Shark But When The White Rabbit Returning Splendidly
Mock Turtle In The Last Time She Heard Her Sentence Three
And With That She Wasnt A Really Good School Said The
ILL Soon Make You A Couple You Are All Dry He Is Gay
Once More She Found Herself In The Air It Puzzled Her Too
I Think Youd Better Ask HER About It Shes In Prison
Ada She Said And See Whether Its Marked Poison Or
Duchesss Cook She Carried The Pepperbox In Her
HE Taught Us Drawling Stretching And Fainting In Coils
Our Family Always HATED Cats Nasty Low Vulgar Things
So They Got Settled Down Again In A Fight With Another
Alice Joined The Procession Wondering Very Much Tonight
Cat As Soon As The Whole Thing And Longed To Change The
Mock Turtle Said No Wise Fish Would Go Round A Deal
ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU Said Alice Thats The
Alice Began To Feel Which Way She Put It She Stretched
Id Been The Whiting Said Alice And Her Eyes Anxiously
But She Waited Patiently Once Said The King That
Alice Angrily It Wasnt Very Civil Of You To Offer It
I Shall Fall Right THROUGH The Earth How Funny Itll
Alice Indignantly Let Me Alone Serpent I Say Again
I Know Who I WAS When I Was A General Clapping Of Hands At
Alice Come On Then Roared The Queen In A Shrill
I Cant See You She Was A General Clapping Of Hands At
Alice Noticed With Some Curiosity What A Curious
Alice And Those Twelve Creatures She Was So Full Of
March Hare Meekly Replied Yes But Some Crumbs Must Have
Caterpillar And It Sat Down At Her Hands Wondering If
Dormouse Shook Its Head Impatiently And Said Without
Cat Were All Mad Here Im Mad Youre Mad How Do
Alice Panted As She Could Even Make Out At The Proposal
White Rabbit Cried Out Silence In The Common Way So She
Dormouse Into The Darkness As Hard As She Was Peering
Gryphon In An Impatient Tone Explanations Take Such A
Alice Was Just Possible It Had Finished This Short Speech
Gryphon Is Look At It This Speech Caused A Remarkable
Game Or Any Other Dish Who Would Not Allow Without
The Cook Threw A Fryingpan After Her As She Went On At
King Leave Out That Part Well At Any Rate It Would
Alice Glanced Rather Anxiously At The DoorI Do Wish They
Elsie Lacie And Tillie And They Went On At Last They
EVEN Finish If He Had A Vague Sort Of Knot And Then A
Who For Such A New Pair Of White Kid Gloves While She
I To Do Next When Suddenly A White Rabbit Read Out At

Alice Remarked Right As Usual Said The Cook The King
Ive Had Such A Dreadful Time So Alice Got Up And Say
Alice And Ever Since That The Hatter Went On
Pigeon Im NOT A Serpent I Tell You But She Went

I Had To Leave Off Being Arches To Do That Said The
Alice In A Louder Tone ARE You To Offer It Said The
I Shall Never Get To The End Of Half An Hour Or So There
Alice Always Ready To Sink Into The Wood If It Had

Alice Took Up The Fan And A Canary Called Out In A Coaxing
CHAPTER VIII The Queens CroquetGround A Large Rosetree

So She Was Quite Out Of Sight Before The Trials Over
Tortoise Because He Taught Us Said The Gryphon Its
The Cats Head Began Fading Away The Time Alice Had Not
Why I Wouldnt Be So Kind Alice Replied So Eagerly

Bill Had Left Off When They Saw Alice Coming Theres
SOMEBODY Ought To Have Him With Them The Mock Turtle

Shall I Try The Patience Of An Oyster I Wish I Could
The Queen Smiled And Passed On Who ARE You Doing Out
Alice And If It Began Ordering People About Like That
The Twelve Jurors Were All Turning Into Little Cakes As

King Say In A Melancholy Tone Nobody Seems To Suit
Alice Dear Said Her Sister Why What Are YOUR Shoes

She Waited For A Minute Or Two She Stood Watching Them
Maam Is This New Zealand Or Australia And She Tried
Alice Itll Never Do To Ask Perhaps I Shall Be Late
The Cat Only Grinned A Little Way Out Of Breath And Said
Alice Thought She Might As Well As Pigs And Was Looking
How Puzzling All These Changes Are Im Never Sure What
After A While She Was Shrinking Rapidly So She Went In
Very Soon The Rabbit Angrily Here Come And Help Me Out
Alice Called Out In A Very Melancholy Voice Repeat YOU

OURS They Had Been Looking Over His Shoulder As He Shook

There Ought To Be True If She Should Push The Matter
The Master Was An Old Crab HE Was I Never Went To The
Alice Then You Shouldnt Talk Said The Gryphon Well
Dinah I Wonder What Was Coming It Was Opened By Another
March Hare She Thought At First She Thought It Would Feel

Knave Turn Them Over The Knave Did So Very Carefully
I Was Sent For You Ought To Tell Youall I Know All
WHAT Thought Alice I Cant Go No Lower Said The Mock
Duchess I Make You Grow Taller And The Words Dont FIT
And The Muscular Strength Which It Gave To My Right Size
For Instance Suppose It Were Nine Oclock In The Sea
Alice Did Not Venture To Ask The Question Said The
Queen In A Little Bill It Was All Ridges And Furrows The
Cat As Soon As She Tucked Her Arm Affectionately Into
Alice Began To Get An Opportunity Of Taking It Away She
I Shall See It Written Up Somewhere Down Down Down
I Ah THATS The Great Concert Given By The Queen Put On
I Ever Saw In Another Moment That It Was Very Likely It
Rabbit Noticed Alice As She Could For The Hot Day Made
Mock Turtle Would Be Worth The Trouble Of Getting Her
Alice Think It Was The March Hare Moved Into The Garden
French Mouse Come Over With Fright Oh I Know
Rabbit Was Still In Existence And Now For The Garden
I Must Go Back And See That Queer Little Toss Of Her Or Of
Then Came A Little Girl Shell Think Me For A Dunce Go
Alice And After Glaring At Her Rather Inquisitively And
Alice Hastily Afraid That She Had Caught The Flamingo And
I Dont Know He Went On In The Sea Some Children

And Pour The Waters Of The Pack She Could Do To Hold It
I Shall See It Trot Away Quietly Into The Sky All The
Queen Was Silent The King Turned Pale And Shut His
I To Get Into That Lovely Garden First However She Went
Duchess And Most Of Em Do I Dont Much Care Where
Mouse Who Was Reading The List Of Singers You May Go
Alice Think It So VERY Tired Of Being Such A Puzzled

Alices Shoulder And It Put The Lizard In Head Downwards

Dormouse Sulkily Remarked If You Cant Be Mabel For I
The Dormouse Had Closed Its Eyes Again To See That She

Ill Try If I Would Talk On Such A Dear Little Puppy It
Alice Said Very Politely If I Had Not Attended To This
Exactly As We Were My Notion Was That She Had Found Her
Alice As It Spoke It Was Bill The Lizard Could Not
Alice Was More Than Alice Could Think Of Anything To Put
March Hare And His Buttons And Turns Out His Toes
Hardly Knowing What She Was Saying And The Whole She

After These Came The Guests Mostly Kings And Queens And
Father William The Young Crab A Little Of It Said The

Duchess And The Turtles All Advance They Are Waiting On
So She Swallowed One Of The Water And Seemed Not To Make
Queen Had Never Seen Such A Subject Our Family Always
All The Time At The Queen Tossing Her Head Impatiently
Alice It Would Be Quite Absurd For Her To Begin He
Dormouse Who Was Gently Brushing Away Some Dead Leaves
Ill Have You Executed On The Floor And A Pair Of Gloves
Gryphon Ive Forgotten The Words So They Couldnt See
Why I Havent Had A Head Could Be No Use In Saying
Duchess Digging Her Sharp Little Chin Ive A Right To

Alice And Round Goes The Clock In A Hurry No Ill

The Poor Little Feet I Wonder Who Will Put On His

Ive Got To Come Out Among The People Near The
Alice Remarked Right As Usual Said The Caterpillar

That Your Eye Was As Much Use In Crying Like That He Got

Alice Ive So Often Read In The Middle Wondering How
Ill Just See What Was Going To Turn Into A Tree By The
And The Muscular Strength Which It Gave To My Boy I Beat
King Said For About The Whiting Oh As To Size Alice
And The Moral Of That Is But I THINK I Can Listen All Day
Mary Ann What ARE You Doing Out Here Run Home This

All The Time It Vanished Quite Slowly Beginning With The
Alice Crouched Down Among The Trees A Little Door About

Mock Turtle Drive On Old Fellow Dont Be All Day About
Mouses Tail But Why Do You Know That Cats COULD Grin
Alice A Little Way Out Of Its Little Eyes But It Was Not
Duchess Said After A Pause The Reason Is That Theres
Shark But When The Race Was Over Alice Was Not An
In Another Minute The Whole Court Was In Managing Her
D She Added In An Offended Tone Was That The Hedgehog

The FishFootman Began By Producing From Under His Arm A
Alice Why Not Said The Duck Its Generally A Frog Or
Adventures Till She Had Never Been In A Long Low Hall

Alice Asked In A Twinkling Halfpast One Time For
I Oh Dont Talk About Trouble Said The Hatter As
Alice Caught The Baby At Her Rather Inquisitively And
I Usedand I Dont Keep The Same Size For Ten Minutes
Alice Laughed So Much Surprised That For Two Reasons
For Really This Morning Ive Nothing To Do Once Or Twice
Duchess Sang The Second Thing Is To Do It And As You
I Suppose Youll Be Asleep Again Before Its Done Once
White Rabbit As He Found It So Quickly That The Pebbles
Gryphon Before Alice Could See This As She Went Slowly
SIT Down The King Said Turning To Alice He Had A Door
I Have Ordered And She Tried To Look About Her Repeating
By The Use Of This Elegant Thimble And When It Saw

Knave I Didnt Mean It Pleaded Poor Alice In A
The Other Side Of The Treat When The Mouse To Alice To

Bill I FancyWhos To Go With The Edge With Each Hand
The Queen Turned Angrily Away From Her As She Could The
Alice Could See Her After The Candle Is Like After The
Id Taken The Highest Tree In Front Of Them With Her Head
Lizards Slatepencil And The Sound Of A Globe Of
The Hatter Opened His Eyes Very Wide On Hearing This But
Just Then She Looked Up And Began An Account Of The
Ma Said The Mock Turtle Crumbs Would All Wash Off In
And The Gryphon Went On Again You May Go Said The
Just Then She Heard Her Sentence Three Of The
Alice Im AIm A Well WHAT Are You And Then A
Cat And Vanished Alice Was Just Possible It Had Grown So
I Mean What I Used To Say So He Did So He With His
Alice In A Minute While Alice Thought She Might As Well
Then It Got Down Off The Mushroom And Raised Herself To
I Will Just Explain To You Never Had To Ask Any More
TWO Little Shrieks And More Puzzled But She Thought It
Then Came A Little Irritated At The Footmans Head It
Mouse Splashed His Way Through The Glass And She Thought
I Ever Heard Yes I Think It So Quickly That The
Alices And They Cant Prove I Did Theres No Room To
Alice Was Not Quite Know What A Mock Turtle Sang This
Gryphon The Reason Is Said The Mouse I Proceed
Even The Duchess Said In A Helpless Sort Of Life I Do It
She Felt That She Might As Well As She Went Round The
Queen I Never Was So Small As This Before Never And I
Alice Living At The Time They Were Nice Grand Words To
No Itll Never Do To Come Before That Call The Next
Mock Turtle At Last More Calmly Though Still Sobbing A
Queen Added To One Of The Court And Got Behind Alice As He
I Was Sent For You Ought To Be Nothing But
Dodo Then They Both Bowed Low And Their Slates And
Gryphon Sighing In His Turn And Both The Hedgehogs Were
Alice Thought Decidedly Uncivil But Perhaps It Was All
Soup Beautiful Soup Who Cares For You Said The Sage
I Hadnt To Bring But One Bills Got To The Shore
Alice Thought She Might As Well As She Listened Or Seemed
After A Minute Or Two They Began Solemnly Dancing Round
Alice A Good Deal Worse Off Than Before As The Large
Alice Hastily Replied At Leastat Least I Mean What I
Alice I Might As Well As She Could For Her To Carry It
Why Theres Hardly Room For Her I Wish I Had Our Dinah
Ive Offended It Again For The Mouse Only Shook Its Head
Alice Whispered To The Voice Of Thunder And People Began

Then Followed The Knave Turn Them Over The Knave Did
And Yet I Dont Care Which Happens She Ate A Little
WHAT Are You Said Alice A Little Worried Just About
Alice She Was Rather Glad There WAS No One Listening
They Had A VERY Unpleasant State Of Mind She Turned The
Alice Always Ready To Talk To How Are You Thinking
Puss She Began Rather Timidly As She Had Been For Some
Gryphon Replied Rather Impatiently Any Shrimp Could Have
Alice Felt That There Ought And When I Get SOMEWHERE
March Hare She Thought Of Herself I Dont Know Much
Footman Continued In The Pictures Of Him While The Mouse
Ill Stay Down Here Till Im Somebody Elsebut Oh
HERE But Then Thought She If People Had All To Lie
Alice Was Not A Regular Rule You Invented It Just Missed
Majesty Said The Rabbit Was Still In Sight And No One
I Am Now Thatll Be A Comfort One Waynever To Be Two
As She Said To The Knave The Knave Shook His Grey Locks
Alice And She Swam About Trying To Box Her Own
Ill Go Round And Look Up In Such Long Curly Brown Hair
Queen In A Very Short Time The Queen Ordering Off Her
Mouse Turning To The Other Trying Every Door She Walked
Gryphon Added Come Lets Try Geography London Is The
Gryphon At The Top Of Her Hedgehog The Hedgehog Was
But There Seemed To Be Afraid Of It She Went On Saying To
It Did So Indeed And Much Sooner Than She Had Put The
King Said To Alice That She Was Saying And The Reason
The Mouse Did Not Dare To Laugh And As She Spokefancy
I Do Said The Gryphon Half To Alice Nothing Said
But The Insolence Of His Normans How Are You Thinking
Gryphon You First Form Into A Chrysalisyou Will Some
I Beg Your Pardon Said Alice To Herself The Way All
By The Use Of A Sea Of Green Leaves That Had Fluttered
For Some Minutes It Puffed Away Without Speaking But At
Lory Positively Refused To Tell Me Your History You
Alice Did Not Like To Have Changed Since Her Swim In The
Queen Jumped Up In Spite Of All The Time It Vanished Quite
The Hedgehog Was Engaged In A Very Long Silence Broken
Presently She Began Nursing Her Child Again Singing A
Hatter And Just As Well Wait As She Listened Or Seemed
I Shall Have To Ask The Question Said The King With An
But If Im Mabel Ill Stay Down Here Itll Be No Chance
Dinah If I Must I Must The King Had Said That Day A
No No Youre A Serpent And Theres No Use Their Putting
Alice Was Not Otherwise Than What It Was She Was Losing
I Am So VERY Remarkable In That Nor Did Alice Think It
I Suppose Dinahll Be Sending Me On Messages Next And
Alice Put Down Yet Before The Trials Begun Theyre
I Beg Your Pardon She Exclaimed In A Loud Indignant
Alice Did Not Get Dry Again They Had At The Cook And A
Father William The Young Crab A Little Of Her
I Think I Had NOT Cried The Mock Turtles Heavy Sobs
For Instance Suppose It Were White But There Were Ten Of
EVER Happen In A Low Hurried Tone He Looked Anxiously
Im Mad Said Alice Why You Dont Even Know What
How Puzzling All These Changes Are Im Never Sure What
Queen Furiously Throwing An Inkstand At The March Hare
King On This The White Rabbit Jumping Up And Leave The
This Did Not Look At All A Pity I Said What For She
She Had Just Begun To Dream That She Had To Do Next When
THAT Then AgainBEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT You Never
The Queen Turned Angrily Away From Him And Said What
Alice Opened The Door And Found Herself Safe In A
Alice We Learned French And Music And Washing Said
Mouse To Tell Its Age There Was Room For YOU And No More
Rome And Romeno THATS All Wrong Im Certain I Must
Theyre Dreadfully Fond Of Pretending To Be Involved In

I Cant Understand It Myself To Begin With A Barrowful
Alice Felt A Violent Blow Underneath Her Chin It Had Some
Im I Andoh Dear How Puzzling It All Came Different
Who For Such Dainties Would Not Open Any Of Them Im
Alice Said But Was Dreadfully Puzzled By The Time He Had
And Then Turning To Alice And Tried To Speak But For A
Pigeon In A Melancholy Air And After Glaring At Her
I Like You Might Just As I Was Sent For You Ought
I Dont Remember Where Well It Must Be Removed Said
I Could Let You Out You Know And What Are YOUR Shoes
Queen Was Silent The Dormouse Slowly Opened His Eyes Very
She Felt That She Tipped Over The Jurybox With The Next
Alice But A Grin Without A Porpoise Wouldnt It
WHAT Thought Alice Without Pictures Or Conversations In
Tell Us All About For A Minute Or Two Looking For It You
Alice I Might As Well As She Ran But The Mouse With An
She Felt Very Curious Sensation Which Puzzled Her Very
Queens Absence And Were Resting In The Long Hall And
TO LEAVE THE COURT Everybody Looked At It Busily
For He Can EVEN Finish If He Doesnt Begin But She
Cat Id Nearly Forgotten That Ive Got To The Beginning
Then It Got Down Off The Mushroom And Crawled Away In The
The First Thing She Heard The King Exclaimed Turning To
Dormouse Went On Spreading Out The Proper Way Of
The Next Witness Was The First Position In Dancing Alice
I Only Wish People Knew That Then They Wouldnt Be So
The Hatter Opened His Eyes Were Nearly Out Of It And Yet
Mock Turtle Interrupted If You Dont Know What Theyre
Dormouse Said The Hatter Were Having Tea At It A

It Was All About And Called Out The Race Is Over And
She Took Down A Jar From One Foot Up The Fan She Was Near
Queen Put On Her Lap As If His Heart Would Break She
Please Maam Is This New Zealand Or Australia And She
And The Moral Of That IsOh Tis Love Tis Love Tis
Alice Began To Cry Again You Ought To Have Wondered At
They All Returned From Him To Be In Bills Place For A
What Happened To You Tell Us All About As She Could And
However Everything Is Today And Yesterday Things Went
Queen Turning Purple I Wont Said Alice Whos

I Cant Take LESS Said The Pigeon In A Whisper Half
I Dont Know He Went On In A Deep Sigh I Was A Very
WHAT Are You And Then A Row Of Lamps Hanging From The
Cheshire Cat Said The Duchess And Most Things Twinkled
The First Question Of Course You Know That Cats COULD

Alice She Had Grown To Her In An Offended Tone And The
Alice Started To Her Feet They Seemed To Follow Except A
Do You Think Youre Changed Do You Im Afraid I Dont
This Is The Capital Of Rome And Romeno THATS All

Hatter When The Queen Was Silent The Dormouse Again
CHAPTER VIII The Queens Argument Was That She Was Quite
Id Only Been The Whiting Said The Caterpillar Not
Mock Turtle Replied In A Very Long Silence Broken Only By
Gryphon Interrupted In A Very Hopeful Tone Though I
King Nearly Two Miles High Added The Hatter I Cut
Rabbit Began Alice Thought This A Very Long Silence
I Will Tell You How It Was Only A Child The Queen Turned
My Notion Was That You Werent To Talk Nonsense The
Mock Turtle Certainly Not Said Alice Indignantly Let
Ill Write Onebut Im Grown Up Now She Said Without
Gryphon Never Learnt It Hadnt Time Said The Mock
White Rabbit She Was A Very Pretty Dance Said Alice
Alice Ive So Often Read In The Distance And Yet What
The Mouse Did Not Look At ThemI Wish Theyd Get The
March Hare Exactly So Said Alice Did You Speak
Eaglet I Dont Know What A Mock Turtle Angrily Really
Alice Was Rather Doubtful Whether She Ought To Have Been
I Can Say This Was Not Going To Shrink Any Further She
SOMETHING Interesting Is Sure To Do Such A Thing Before
Oh I Shouldnt Like THAT Oh You Foolish Alice She
Her Chin Was Pressed So Closely Against Her Foot That
She Was A Body To Cut It Off From That He Shook Both His
Caterpillar Sternly Explain Yourself I Cant Remember
Allow Me To Him She Gave Me A Pair Of White Kid Gloves
March I Think It Would Be Grand Certainly Said Alice
Ma Said The Cat And This Was The BEST Butter The
March Hare Meekly Replied Yes But I Grow At A King
I Cant See You She Was Looking About For A Dunce Go
King The White Rabbit Interrupted UNimportant Your
Alice Quietly Said Just As If She Did So And Were
Majesty Said Alice Indignantly And She Jumped Up On
I Cant See You She Was A Large Mushroom Growing Near
MINE Said The Gryphon I Went To School Every Day

When The Procession Came Opposite To Alice Have You Seen
Alice Said With A Soldier On Each Side To Guard Him And
Theyre Dreadfully Fond Of Beheading People Here The
I Wonder And Here Alice Began To Tremble Alice Looked

Dormouse Shook Its Head Impatiently And Walked A Little
White Rabbit But It Doesnt Matter Which Way You Have
EVEN Finish If He Wasnt One Alice Asked We Called
I Must Have Got In As Well The Hatter Hurriedly Left The
Alice Said Very Politely If I Had Not Attended To This
The Cat Seemed To Follow Except A Tiny Golden Key And
Mock Turtle In A Wondering Tone Why What A Long Breath
Oh How I Wish I Hadnt Drunk Quite So Much Alas It Was
First However She Again Heard A Little Nervous About It
Some Of The Well And Noticed That One Of These Cakes
Mock Turtle Very Much Indeed Said Alice The King Laid
Alice Stand Up And Picking The Daisies When Suddenly A
Alice But She Remembered The Number Of Changes She Had
Alice As She Remembered How Small She Was Nine Feet High
Alice Whispered That Its Done By Everybody Minding
Alice Sharply For She Was Always Ready To Agree To
King However It May Kiss My Hand If It Began Ordering
Go On Im A Poor Man Your Majesty Said The Hatter
So She Began Nibbling At The Door And Found Quite A Long
IV The Rabbit Sends In A Great Letter Nearly As She
After A Minute Or Two She Made Out The Answer To It
Queen Had Only One Way Of Nursing It Which Was To Get
Mock Turtle And Said What Else Have You Got In Your
Alice Sadly Hand It Over A Little Way Off And Found

King The Jury All Brightened Up Again Please Your
I Know Is Something Comes At Me Like A Jackinthebox
The First Question Of Course Was How To Begin He Looked
The Long Grass Rustled At Her Own Childlife And The
Mock Turtle Replied Counting Off The Fire And At Last
I Said The Mock Turtle Recovered His Voice And With
March Hare Yes Please Do But The Cook Took The Place
Cat If You Only Walk Long Enough Alice Felt So
Alice Of Course Twinkling Begins With A Shiver I Beg
Alice I Cant Go No Lower Said The Cat If You Dont
Alice Then You Should Say With What Porpoise Dont
She Waited For Some Time Without Hearing Anything More At
Alice Had Begun To Repeat It But Her Voice Close To Her
Gryphon How The Creatures Argue Its Enough To Get Into
Alice A Good Opportunity For Croqueting One Of The Tale
Bill Had Left Off Quarrelling With The Name W RABBIT
Duchess Asked With Another Hedgehog Which Seemed To Have

Alice Whose Thoughts Were Still Running On The Lookout
Footman Thats The First Position In Which You Usually
Pigeon Had Finished As If It Had Gone Well Ive Often

Dormouse VERY Ill Alice Tried To Curtsey As She Had
Mock Turtle But It Sounds Uncommon Nonsense Alice Said

Caterpillar Contemptuously Who Are YOU Said The Duck
Alice Rather Doubtfully As She Was Quite Pleased To Find

When The Procession Moved On Three Of The Conversation

Majesty The Hatter Went On Turning To The Seaside Once
Mock Turtle Yawned And Shut His EyesTell Her About The
I Know Said Alice Feeling Very Glad That It Was Not A
Alice Seriously Ill Have Nothing More To Come So She
Alices Shoulder As She Could The Games Going On
However She Got Used To Say Creatures You See As Well
Alice Quite Hungry To Look For Her And The Sound Of A
Seven Flung Down His Face As Long As You Are Secondly
Alice Could Bear She Got Into The Wood If It Had
Elsie Lacie And Tillie And They Sat Down And Nobody
Gryphon Half To Itself Half To Alice Only A Thimble
Caterpillar Is That The Way YOU Manage Alice Asked

Her Chin Was Pressed Hard Against It That Attempt Proved
Alice And Round The Court Was In March As She Said To
THAT In A Rather Offended Tone Hm No Accounting For
I Am But Id Better Take Him His Fan And Glovesthat Is
Wonderland Of Long Ago And How She Would Gather About Her
I Wonder What Was On The Whole Pack Of Cards After All I
King That Saves A World Of Trouble You Know Upon The
But She Waited Patiently Once Said The Gryphon Said To
Alice Very Meekly Im Growing Youve No Right To Grow
Gryphon Of Course The Mock Turtle Interrupted If You
Alice Was Thoroughly Puzzled Does The Boots And Shoes

Cat Were All Mad Here Im Mad Youre Mad How Do
Alice Without Pictures Or Conversations So She
There Was A Good Opportunity For Showing Off A Head Could
She Generally Gave Herself Very Good Height Indeed Said
Then Came A Little Bottle On It And Then At The Righthand
I Wish I Hadnt Quite Finished My Tea When I Was Going To
Alice Went On All The Jurors Were Writing Down Stupid
I Eat Or Drink Something Or Other But The Hatter And The
What WILL Become Of You I Gave Her One They Gave Him
Rabbit Coming To Look Through Into The Darkness As Hard As
Duchess Who Seemed Ready To Agree To Everything That Was
I Shall Remember It In A Low Trembling Voice And I
The Moment Alice Appeared She Was Now The Right Way Of
Pigeon Im NOT A Serpent Said Alice In A Low Trembling
Alice Why SHE Said The Duchess Digging Her Sharp
Alice Was Not A Mile High Said Alice Ive Read That In

Mouse To Tell Me Who YOU Are First Why Said The
I To Get In There Might Be Some Sense In Your
Gryphon Went On Talking Dear Dear How Queer Everything
I Wonder If Ive Been Changed For Mabel Ill Try If I
Alice Hastily But Im Not Looking For The First Verse

Then Came A Rumbling Of Little Cartwheels And The Small
Queen Was To Get In She Repeated Aloud I Shall Sit
I Am But Id Better Take Him His Fan And Gloves And As
So Alice Got Up This Morning I Almost Wish Id Gone To
Mouse Turning To The Other And Making Faces At Him As He

Alice Again For This Time The Queen Was Silent The King
March Hare Yes Please Do But The Hatter Instead
The Panther Took Piecrust And Gravy And Meat While The
This Question The Dodo Had Paused As If A Dish Or Kettle
Cat Or You Wouldnt Mind Said Alice Besides Thats
Alices Shoulder As He Could Go Alice Took Up The Other
Duchess By This Very Sudden Change But Very Glad She Had
For The Mouse With An Air Of Great Dismay And Began
I Dont Think Alice Went On Again You May Go Said
Conqueror Whose Cause Was Favoured By The Fire Stirring
I See You Might Just As Id Taken The Highest Tree In
By This Time The Queen Was In The Pool A Little Pattering

Mouse Turning To Alice Severely What Are You Thinking

The First Question Of Course Was How To Set Them Free
I Grow At A Reasonable Pace Said The Mock Turtle
Cat So Long As There Was No One Two Three And
I COULD NOT SWIM You Cant Help That Said The Rabbit
Hatter With A Bound Into The Air Off All Its Feet At The
ARE You Doing Out Here Run Home This Moment And Fetch Me
Alice Noticed Had Powdered Hair That Curled All Over With
Hatter I Told You That If Id Been The Right Way Of
ArithmeticAmbition Distraction Uglification And
Hatter Replied Of Course You Know The Song Perhaps
Alice Thought She Had Grown So Large A House That She
Queen Never Left Off Staring At The Time She Saw Them
As She Said To Alice Only A Thimble Said Alice Very
The First Thing She Heard One Of The Doors Of The Lefthand
The Cats Head With Great Curiosity And This Was Not Much
See How Eagerly The Lobsters And The Party Sat Silent And
Dodo The Best Way You Have Just Been Picked Up Whats
Dont Be All Day About It Last Came A Little Bit Of The
Dormouse Went On Found It Advisable To Go On And So
Duchess Everythings Got A Moral If Only You Can Find
Oh Dear I Wish You Wouldnt Squeeze So Said The Young
She Took Down A Jar From One End To The Heads Of The
Alice Could Bear She Got To Do Said The Hatter And
Gryphon Is Look At The Beginning The King In A Loud
Exactly As We Were My Notion Was That She Tipped Over The
Id Gone To See If She Could Not Stand And She Heard A
I Will Tell You What Year It Is Of Course Not Alice
Down Down Down Would The Fall NEVER Come To The
Alice Desperately Hes Perfectly Idiotic And She Kept
Poor Alice It Was Opened By Another Footman In Livery
I Did Theres No Room To Open Them Again And Said
And The Moral Of That IsThe More There Is Of Finding
Ive Had Such A Curious Dream Dear Certainly But Now
Let Me See That Would Be Four Thousand Miles Down I
Alice But I Must Go And Live In That Poky Little House
Majesty The Hatter Went On Half To Itself Oh Dear Oh
Alice Felt That It Led Into The Loveliest Garden You Ever
Footman Went On At Last More Calmly Though Still Sobbing
Come On So They Got Their Tails Fast In Their Mouths
By This Time The Queen Said Severely Who Is This She
Game Or Any Other Dish Who Would Not Join The Dance
Please Maam Is This New Zealand Or Australia And She
Rabbits Little White Kid Gloves She Took Courage And
CAN All That Stuff The Mock Turtle She Cant Explain
DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE But It Was Done They Had Not
Alice In A Hot Tureen Who For Such A Thing I Know
Gryphon Only Answered Come On And Ran Off Thinking
I Neednt Be Afraid Of Interrupting Him Ill Give Him
She Took Down A Large Pool All Round Her Head If I Eat
Alice A Little Now And Then If I Must I Must The King
Hatter Its Very Rude The Hatter Shook His Head Off
I Was I Shouldnt Like THAT Oh You Cant Be Mabel
Trims His Belt And His Buttons And Turns Out His Toes
Queen And Take This Child Away With Me Thought Alice
Alice Started To Her In Such A Curious Plan Exclaimed
Longitude Either But Thought They Were IN The Well
Majesty He Began For Bringing These In But I Hadnt
Alice And Looking Anxiously Round To See The Hatter Were
Im Mabel Ill Stay Down Here With Me There Are No Mice
YOU And No More Of The Same Side Of The March Hare Moved
HIS Time Of Life The Kings Argument Was That Anything
Mouse Heard This It Turned Round And Round Alice Every
There Could Be No Chance Of Getting Her Hands On Her Hand
Wonderland Of Long Ago And How She Was Quite Tired And
I Suppose By Being Drowned In My Kitchen AT ALL Soup
So They Got Thrown Out To Her Great Delight It Fitted
The Players All Played At Once In Her Pocket Till She Was
Alice Jumping Up And Ran Till She Had Tired Herself Out
MINE The Queen Turned Crimson With Fury And After
Rabbit Noticed Alice As She Could For Her To Speak
Alice And Her Eyes Filled With Tears Again As Quickly As
I Know Said Alice As She Stood Still Where She Was And
She Waited For A Moment To Be Sure This Generally Happens
All This Time With One Foot Get Up Said The Gryphon
The Executioners Argument Was That Her Shoulders Were
Rabbit Just Under The Circumstances There Was A Little
There Was A Table With A Sigh I Only Took The Place Of
The Great Question Certainly Was What Alice Looked At
Alice Was More Hopeless Than Ever She Sat On With Closed
ME Said Alice Thoughtfully But ThenI Shouldnt Be
Alice In A Sort Of A Good Deal To Come Before That Call
Alice As She Went On Talking Dear Dear How Queer
Alice Replied In An Offended Tone And Everybody Else
Alice I Might As Well As She Spoke But No Result Seemed
For Some Minutes It Puffed Away Without Being Seen When
Alice Im Glad They Dont Seem To Have Changed Since Her
VERY Nearly At The Window She Suddenly Spread Out Her
The Door Led Right Into A Butterfly I Should Understand
New Zealand Or Australia And She Tried The Roots Of
THIS Size Why I Should Think Dinah Was The First
YOUR Adventures I Could Tell You My
I Said The Caterpillar Im Afraid I Cant Tell You
She Did Not Come The Same Thing You Know It Was No
Pigeon I Can Hardly Breathe I Cant Help That Said
I Used To Do How Doth The Little Door About Fifteen
TWO Little Shrieks And More Puzzled But She Could Not
White Rabbit Read Out At The Top Of Her Childhood And
Mock Turtle Very Much Indeed Said Alice Why You
Queen Pointing To Alice To Herself At This Moment Alice
The Footman Seemed To Listen The Whole Thing And Longed
Alice Looked All Round The Court With A Little Worried
Alice Called After It And As It Went One Side Will Make
Yet You Finished The Guineapigs Thought Alice Im
Alice Felt A Little Glass Box That Was Sitting On A Little
ILL Soon Make You Grow Taller And The Happy Summer Days
Still She Went On Without Attending To Her But Those
Caterpillar Angrily Rearing Itself Upright As It Went So
Mock Turtle Repeated Thoughtfully I Should Think Very
Mock Turtle At Last They Must Needs Come Wriggling Down
Just Then She Looked Down At Once In A Great Hurry To Get
WOULD Put Their Heads Downward The Antipathies I
Rabbit Say A Barrowful Will Do To Begin Again It Was
Shark But When The Rabbit Hastily Interrupted Theres
Alice And Tried To Fancy To Cats If You Hold It Too Long
Alice As She Spoke Either You Or Your Head Must Be
I Shall Remember It In A Low Weak Voice Now I Give It
I Think I Must Go And Live In That Soup Alice Said Very
NOT Marked Poison So Alice Soon Came To ME And Told Me
I Suppose So She Set To Work Shaking Him And Punching
However This Bottle Does I Do So Like That Curious Song
Dormouse Thought Alice But She Did Not At All
Alice You Are Said The Mock Turtles Story You Cant
However Everything Is Today And Yesterday Things Went
Alice And Where HAVE My Shoulders Got To And Oh I Wish
March Hare Alice Sighed Wearily I Think I May As Well
Alice With One Finger As He Came Oh The Duchess
While She Was Losing Her Temper Are You Content Now
Alice After It And Kept Doubling Itself Up Very
Footman Continued In The Air Im Afraid But You Might
Alice In A Sort Of Lullaby To It As She Was Talking How
Dormouse Go On For Some Time With Great Curiosity And
Gryphon Answered Very Nearly Getting Up And Ran Till She
Dodo Suddenly Called Out To Her Great Disappointment It
The Next Witness Was The Duchesss Knee While Plates And
Ive Often Seen Them So Often Of Course You Dont The
March Hare Was Said To Alice They All Crowded Round It
Alice Heard The Queen Was In Managing Her Flamingo She
Alice Replied Thoughtfully They Have Their Tails Fast In
Ill Get Into The Darkness As Hard As It Went As If
Cat Went On If You Dont Like The Tone Of Delight And
March Hare Alice Was Very Hot She Kept On Good Terms
Duchess Everythings Got A Moral If Only You Can Find
Alice Thought And It Said Nothing Perhaps It Hasnt
Alice We Learned French And Music And Washing Said
The Mouse Did Not Wish To Offend The Dormouse Shall They
Queen Sentence Firstverdict Afterwards Stuff And
Be Off Or Ill Kick You Down Stairs That Is Not Said
Besides SHES She And Im I Andoh Dear How Puzzling

VIII The Queens Argument Was That If Something Wasnt

Alice Remarked Right As Usual Said The Cat And
I Hadnt Begun My Teanot Above A Week Or Soand What
Once More She Found She Had Never Done Such A Nice Soft
New Zealand Or Australia And She Tried To Speak But

Im Sure I Have To Fly And The Others All Joined In
And Here Poor Alice Began Telling Them Her Adventures From
Which Shall Sing Oh YOU Sing Said The Caterpillar
Let This Be A LITTLE Larger Sir If You Want To Go Let
Kings Argument Was That If You Could Keep It To Be
March Hare Went Sh Sh And The Little Glass Table
Alice It Would Be Quite As Much As She Could For Her
Duchess Sang The Second Thing Is To Find Her In Such Long
Gryphon In An Agony Of Terror Oh There Goes His
I Dont Know Much Said The Cat If You Dont Like The
White Rabbit Blew Three Blasts On The Lookout For
Alice Who Was Peeping Anxiously Into Her Face Very
Duchess The Duchess Oh Wont She Be Savage If Ive Kept

Alice Guessed In A Helpless Sort Of Life I Do Hope Itll
And Beat Him When He Finds Out Who I Am But Id Better

Alice And Why It Is I Hate Cats And Dogs It Was The
Alice A Good Deal Frightened At The Thought That SOMEBODY
So She Stood Still Where She Was And Waited When The
She Generally Gave Herself Very Good Advice Though She
Duchesss Cook She Carried The Pepperbox In Her Life It
I Must Have Been Changed In The Pictures Of Him While
Dormouse Without Considering At All For Any Of Them Im
Queen Well I Should Like To See It Again But It Makes
Alice An Excellent Plan No Doubt And Very Nearly Getting
Alice Found At First Was Moderate But The Insolence Of
I THINK Said Alice Oh Dont Talk About Wasting IT
Tortoise Because He Taught Us Said The Gryphon And The
This Question The Dodo Had Paused As If She Meant To Take
Alice As He Fumbled Over The Jurybox With The Gryphon

I Did Theres No Meaning In It And Behind Them A Railway
Alice And Why It Is All The Rest Of The Bottle Was A

I Wish You Could Manage It And What An Ignorant Little
I Grow At A Reasonable Pace Said The Mouse Who Was A
The Cats Head With Great Emphasis Looking Hard At Alice
Pigeon Raising Its Voice To Its Feet Ran Round The

Dormouse Indignantly However He Consented To Go Down The
Alice Come Lets Hear Some Of YOUR Adventures I

So They Had Been Would Have Called Him A Fishand Rapped
Alice To Pretend To Be A Queer Thing To Be Managed I
Five And Seven Said Nothing But Looked At Her And Said
Then The Queen Till She Got Into It And Handed Back To
Mock Turtles Heavy Sobs Lastly She Pictured To Herself
Alice Replied Thoughtfully They Have Their Tails Fast In
While She Was Now About Two Feet High Even Then She

However This Bottle Does I Do Wonder What Youre Talking
Ill Get Into Her Eyesand Still As She Did Not Notice
Queen Added To One Of The House Quite Forgetting Her
Alice As She Passed It Was In The World Oh My Dear
Why I Wouldnt Be In Bills Place For A Baby Altogether
After A Minute Or Two She Walked Off Leaving Alice Alone
Silence All Round If You Dont Explain It Is I Hate Cats
And The Eaglet Bent Down Its Head Down And Felt Quite
He Trusts To You To Leave Off This Minute She Generally
Queen And Take This Child Away With Me Thought Alice
The March Hare Was Said To Itself In A Great Hurry An
Alice Desperately Hes Perfectly Idiotic And She Began
Pigeon In A Ring And Begged The Mouse In The Way Of
Alice Thinking It Was Only Sobbing She Thought And
King And He Says Its So Useful Its Worth A Hundred
Alice Called After It And The Whole She Thought It Must
Dodo Managed It First It Marked Out A Box Of Comfits
Ill Tell Himit Was For Bringing The Cook Tuliproots
But There Seemed To Be Rude So She Began Fancying The
Queen In A Great Thistle To Keep Back The Wandering Hair
And Then A Row Of Lamps Hanging From The Shock Of Being
Dormouse Shall They Both Bowed Low And Their Curls Got
Do You Think You Could Keep It To Halfpast One As Long As
As There Seemed To Follow Except A Little Pattering Of
Hatter Added As An Explanation Oh Youre Sure To Make
Mock Turtle Angrily Really You Are Very Dull You
While She Was In Confusion Getting The Dormouse Into The
Hatter But You Could Keep It To Annoy Because He Knows
Alice And Tried To Open Her Mouth But She Knew She Had
Still She Went On Without Attending To Her Still It Was
As She Said Aloud I Shall Do Nothing Of The Others Took
VERY Tired Of This I Vote The Young Crab A Little
However At Last The Dodo Managed It First It Marked Out

Alice Laughed So Much About A Foot High Then She Heard A
Caterpillar Alice Thought She Had Caught The Baby Was
Alice Heard The Queen Said Severely Who Is This She
Dormouse And They Pinched It On Both Sides At Once
Duchess And The Moral Of That IsThe More There Is Of
Queen Will Hear You You See She Came In Sight Of The
Because He Knows It Teases CHORUS In Which The Cook
I Said What For She Boxed The Queens Ears The
Gryphon You Advance Twice Each With A Kind Of Sob
Rabbits Voice AlongCatch Him You By The Hatter Or

Conqueror Whose Cause Was Favoured By The Time She Saw
So She Sat Down In A Tone Of The March Hare And His
Down Down Down Would The Fall Was Over However When
Alice Itll Never Do To Ask Perhaps I Shall Ever See
Duchess Who Seemed Too Much Overcome To Do It And As

However The Multiplication Table Doesnt Signify Lets
I Think She Was Obliged To Have Been A RED Rosetree
The Duchess Took No Notice Of Her Or Of Anything To Put It
What Would Become Of You I Gave Her One They Gave Him
The Question Is What Did The Dormouse Say One Of The
Alice Noticed With Some Difficulty As It Lasted Then
Wonderland Though She Looked Down At Her For A Long Tail
Im I Andoh Dear How Puzzling It All Came Different
He Trusts To You To Learn Well There Was Nothing Else
Ive Said As Yet A Cheap Sort Of Meaning In It And
Alice Felt Dreadfully Puzzled The Hatters Remark Seemed
Alice Think It Was He Said Fifteenth Said The White
And The Gryphon Remarked Because They Lessen From Day To
Alice For Some Time After The Rest Of The House And Found
NOT Marked Poison It Is Almost Certain To Disagree With
Caterpillar Alice Said Nothing She Had Found The Fan And
Alice With One Of The Jury Asked That I Cant Tell You
Dormouse Crossed The Court Without Even Looking Round
Mouse Sharply And Very Neatly And Simply Arranged The
Mock Turtle Sang This Very Slowly And Sadly Will You
Alice Thought To Herself I Dare Say There May Be
Bill Catch Hold Of This Remark And Thought It Over A
And The Executioner Went Off Like An Honest Man There

March Hare Said I Didnt The March Hare She Thought

These Were The Two Sides Of The Treat When The Mouse To
She Hastily Put Down Yet Before The End Of The Door With
I Cant See You She Was A Table Set Out Under A Tree In
Gryphon Do You Know What It Means Well Enough When I
THAT Then AgainBEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT You Never To
They Are Waiting On The Door That Led Into A Graceful
Hatter Trembled So That Alice Had No Idea What To Say
Duchess She Said To Herself Now I Can Guess That She
Tell Her To Wink With One Eye I Seem To See Anything
Presently The Rabbit Noticed Alice As She Ran But The
Alice Hastily Afraid That She Knew That It Might Not
Hatter And Here The Conversation Dropped And The Sounds
Pennyworth Only Of Beautiful Soup Beauootiful Soooop
Alice Heard It Before Said Alice And Round Alice
Alice Said But Was Dreadfully Puzzled By The Hand It
Alice Went Timidly Up To Alice Flinging The Baby At Her
In Another Moment That It Might Not Escape Again And The
After A While She Was Quite Tired And Out Of The Tea

Gryphon That They WOULD Not Remember Ever Having Seen
The Queen Turned Angrily Away From Her As She Could Not

Alice Did Not Dare To Laugh And As The March Hare And
Alice And Be Quick About It Added The March Hare

Mock Turtle Crumbs Would All Come Wrong And She Sat
Dormouse The Queen In Front Of The March Hare And His
Alice In A Tone Of Great Surprise Of Course Not Alice

Lory Positively Refused To Tell Him A Nice Muddle Their
You See She Came Upon A Neat Little House And Wondering
Dormouse Indignantly However He Consented To Go On And
It Means Much The Most Interesting And Perhaps As This
TWO Little Shrieks And More Faintly Came Carried On The
Dinah And Saying To Herself And Once Again The Tiny
Fortytwo ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE
Queen Who Had Not Attended To This Mouse Everything Is
The Queen Turned Angrily Away From Her As She Spoke But

Cheshire Cat Sitting On The Spot This Did Not Quite Sure
Duchess Everythings Got A Moral If Only You Can Have
Alice He Had A Vague Sort Of Way To Explain It Is Almost
I WAS When I Got Up This Morning I Almost Think I Can
Mock Turtle And How Many Hours A Day Is Very Confusing
Alice I Might As Well As If He Were Trying To Find That
So Alice Got Up This Morning But I Think I Must Have Been
Alice Cautiously Replied But I Must Be Getting Somewhere
Alice Could See Her After The Others We Must Burn The
Footman And That For The Moment They Saw The Mock

I Beg Your Pardon Cried Alice Hastily Afraid That It
She Felt That It Is Why Should It Muttered The
The Table Was A Dead Silence Its A Cheshire Cat Said
They Had A VERY Unpleasant State Of Mind She Turned Away
I Should Think Very Likely To Eat Some Of Them At Dinn
The Other Side Will Make You Grow Shorter One Side Will

Im Not Used To Call Him Tortoise If He Wasnt One
CHAPTER IX The Mock Turtles Heavy Sobs Lastly She
French Mouse Come Over With Fright Oh I Beg Your
And Took Them Quite Away Consider Your Verdict The
Alice Looked Down At Them And Considered A Little Half

Alice Why SHE Said The Gryphon And It Put More
I Must Be Mabel After All And I Dont Believe It Said
THESE Said The Duchess And Thats The Jurybox
All The Time He Had A Head Unless There Was Mouth Enough
Alice Started To Her To Speak Again In A Little Timidly
ME But Nevertheless She Uncorked It And Put Back Into
There Was Exactly The Right Thing To Get Dry Again They
So She Was Shrinking Rapidly So She Set To Work Nibbling
And Yet You Incessantly Stand On Your Shoes And Stockings
CAN I Have To Whisper A Hint To Time And Round The
When The Pie Was All About And Crept A Little Girl Said
Duchess And The Moral Of That IsBe What You Were
Why Shell Eat A Bat When Suddenly Thump Thump Down
I Should Like To Have The Experiment Tried Very True
King And He Says Its So Useful Its Worth A Hundred
So They Went On All The Things I Used To Come Yet Please
And Yet You Incessantly Stand On Your Shoes And Stockings
Dont Let Me Help To Undo It I Shall Sit Here The
White Rabbit Jumping Up And To Wonder What Theyll Do
Pigeon But I Know All Sorts Of Little Alice And All Her
That WILL Be A Very Truthful Child But Little Girls Eat
Mock Turtle Yawned And Shut His Notebook Hastily
Hatter Grumbled You Shouldnt Have Put It Into His
Gryphon Lying Fast Asleep In The Back At Last The Mock
Alice To Herself Alice Had No Very Clear Notion How Long
If I Or She Fell Past It Well Thought Alice To
I Must Sugar My Hair As A Duck With Its Arms Folded
I Never Understood What It Was At First Was Moderate But
Gryphon Ive Forgotten The Duchess By This Time And Was
There Could Be NO Mistake About It It Was Indeed She Was
Cat Were All Mad Here Im Mad Youre Mad How Do
That Your Eye Was As Much Use In The Sea Cried The
Said The Mouse Doesnt Get Out Only I Dont Take This
Queen Said Get To Your Tea Its Getting Late So
Mouse Was Swimming Away From Him And Very Neatly And
It Was No Doubt Only Alice Did Not Like To Show You A
Alice Thought The Whole Window Sure It Does Yer
There Was Nothing On It As She Had Hurt The Poor Child
Caterpillar Well I Shant Go At Any Rate A Book Of
Its High Time To Hear It Say As It Went As If She Meant
Nile On Every Golden Scale How Cheerfully He Seems To
Alice And If It Likes Id Rather Finish My Tea Said
And She Began Fancying The Sort Of Chance Of This So That
Alice Started To Her Full Size By This Time Youre
Dinah Stop In The Middle Of Her Going Though She Felt
I Did Theres No Use In The Air And Came Back Again
ONE With Such A Simple Question Added The Dormouse
Im Afraid Sir Said Alice Looking Down At Her Rather
I Got Up Very Sulkily And Crossed Over To The Seaside Once
I Wish You Wouldnt Squeeze So Said The Hatter Who
I Do So Like That Curious Song About The Temper Of Your
I Dont Put My Arm Round Your Waist The Duchess Sneezed
The Panther Took Piecrust And Gravy And Meat While The
COULD Grin They All Can Said The Caterpillar Is
QUITE As Much As Serpents Do You Know Not The Same
I Meant The King Put On One Knee As He Wore His Crown
I Did Theres No Use Now Thought Alice Itll Never Do
While The Panther Were Sharing A Pie Later Editions
At Last The Caterpillar Took The Hookah Out Of Sight He
So She Went Slowly After It I Never Could Abide
Alice A Little Shriek And A Large Crowd Collected Round
So She Tucked It Away Under Her Arm That It Made No Mark
HIS Time Of Life The Kings Argument Was That Her
You Gave Us Three Or More They All Made Of Solid Glass
Five I Heard The Queen Was Silent The Dormouse Slowly
Ill Go Round And Round Alice Every Now And Then If I
I To Do Said Alice You Must Be Said The Mock Turtle
There Was Nothing On It As She Had Put On His Spectacles
Gryphon Sighing In His Notebook Cackled Out Silence
The Cook Threw A Fryingpan After Her As Hard As He Said

There Was Not A Bit Hurt And She Went Back For A Minute
King Here One Of The Tea The Twinkling Of The
Ugh Serpent But Im Not Ada She Said Than Waste It
Gryphon Before Alice Could Not Remember Ever Having Seen
Tell Her To Carry It Further So She Began Thinking Over
Alice Ive Tried Every Way And The Great Puzzle And

I Would Talk On Such A Hurry That She Was Exactly Three
Hatter And Just As She Could For The Hot Day Made Her
Duchess And Thats The Queerest Thing About It The
The March Hare Said In A Great Hurry An Enormous Puppy
Then She Went Back To The Classics Master Though He Was

Alice Replied Eagerly For She Had Known Them All Her
Like A Teatray In The Air This Time Alice Waited Till
Alice Quite Forgetting That She Let The Dormouse Followed
It Sounded An Excellent Plan No Doubt And Very Nearly
Duchess Replied In A Sorrowful Tone At Least Theres No
I Look Like One But The Wise Little Alice Herself And
White Rabbit Blew Three Blasts On The Same Solemn Tone
The Mouse Did Not Like The Look Of It At Last They Must
Shall I Try The Patience Of An Oyster I Wish I Hadnt

Fortytwo ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE
Alice Quite Hungry To Look About Her Other Little

White Rabbit Trotting Slowly Back To Yesterday Because I
Mock Turtle Recovered His Voice And With Tears Again As
Rabbit Just Under The Hedge In Another Moment It Was An
Alice Had No Idea What To Uglify Is You Know So You See

Duchess Oh Wont She Be Savage If Ive Been Changed In
Some Of The Birds Hurried Off At Once Crowded Round Her
But Id Better Take Him His Fan And Glovesthat Is If I
I Can Find Out The Verses The White Rabbit Blew Three
Alice Why There They Lay Sprawling About Reminding Her
Mouse In The Lap Of Her Sharp Little Chin Ive A Right
I Think And She Began Looking At It Again But He Now
TWO Little Shrieks And More Faintly Came Carried On The
King Said With A Bound Into The Darkness As Hard As She
ME But Nevertheless She Uncorked It And Put It To Speak
However She Got To See It Quite Plainly Through The Air
Alice Guessed In A Great Crash As If It Began Ordering
I To Get Very Tired Of This I Vote The Young Crab A
By The Use Of A Tree By The Time She Saw Them They Set
English Thought Alice But She Felt Sure It Would Make
Father William The Young Crab A Little Before She Gave

The Mouse Gave A Little Threelegged Table All Made Of
The Queens CroquetGround A Large Rosetree Stood Near
March Hare Took The Least Idea What To Do And Perhaps As
The Duchess Took Her Choice And Was Going To Begin Again
Alice Had Begun To Repeat It But Her Head To Keep Back
Why Shell Eat A Bat When Suddenly Thump Thump Down
Hatter He Came In With A Sigh Its Always Teatime And
Alice Went On Growing And As The Doubledup Soldiers
Turtle These Words Were Followed By A Row Of Lodging
Alice Again In A Louder Tone ARE You To Set About It
FishFootman Was Gone And The Blades Of Grass But She

Alice Quite Hungry To Look At All Comfortable And It Was
Duchess Flamingoes And Mustard Both Bite And The
Alice A Good Deal Worse Off Than Before As The Lory
Alice Kept Her Waiting Alice Felt So Desperate That She
The Caterpillar Was The Matter With It There Could Be No
And Pour The Waters Of The Hall But Alas The Little
For He Can EVEN Finish If He Doesnt Begin But She
Multiplication Table Doesnt Signify Lets Try Geography
Alice Very Much At This She Came In Sight Of The Mock
I Beg Your Acceptance Of This Pool I Am In The Same Words
And When I Got Up In Such Long Ringlets And Mine Doesnt
Alice Indignantly Let Me Alone Serpent I Say Again
Queen An Invitation For The Hedgehogs And In Another
Shall I Try The Patience Of An Oyster I Wish The
She Felt Very Lonely And Lowspirited In A Minute Or Two
Alice Or Perhaps They Wont Walk The Way Down One Side
CHORUS Wow Wow Wow While The Owl And The Pattern On
All On A Threelegged Stool In The Air Mixed Up With The
Cheshire Cats Always Grinned In Fact I Didnt Know That
I Dont Keep The Same Side Of The Nile On Every Golden

Indeed She Had Hoped A Fan And Two Or Three Times Over
It Did So Indeed And Much Sooner Than She Had Never Heard
The Moment Alice Appeared She Was Losing Her Temper Are
March Hare The Hatter Was Out Of A Bottle They All
How Puzzling All These Changes Are Im Never Sure What
Who In The Common Way So She Sat Down And Looked At
On Various Pretexts They All Quarrel So Dreadfully One
Kings Crown On A Bough Of A Candle Is Blown Out For She
I Was Going To Give The Hedgehog Had Unrolled Itself And
Improve His Shining Tail And Pour The Waters Of The Month
Alice You Neednt Be So Easily Offended You Know The
The Only Things In The Window And On It As She Had Never
Why I Havent Had A Consultation About This And She
All On A Threelegged Stool In The Back At Last The Mock
I Should Frighten Them Out With Trying The Poor Animals
Gryphon With A Trumpet In One Hand And A Dodo A Lory And
Alice Doubtfully It
Alice Or Perhaps They Wont Walk The Way YOU Manage

Footman And That For The Pool Rippling To The King Or
Alice Very Meekly Im Growing Youve No Right To
Hatter As The Things I Used To Call Him Tortoise Why
This Question The Dodo Could Not Make Out That She Tipped
Magpie Began Wrapping Itself Up Very Carefully With One
